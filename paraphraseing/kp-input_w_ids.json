            "text": "\"Not only does the new technology of digital mixers inable easy live gig set up\" Did I not go into detail on why its a whole lot easier to set up in analog. \"...they're also more cost efficient. Instead of byuing the multiple parts and gadgetry needed for an Analog run show, you can buy a digital mixer for the same price and get a higher quality product\" First of all, I also addressed the fact that digital boards do not provide a better sounding show. I'll put my life on it that if I were to set up both type of systems on the same band, no one would be able to tell the difference unless they actually were the sound tech. Second as for cost efficiency, to actually buy the digital board vs. all the parts that would make the same thing is just about the same price range. I'll give you a perk as to why purchasing all the parts separately would be better. You know whats going into your system. Lets see do I want Yamamha deciding what compressors I use or can I chose DBX or Alesis. If a part goes bad, easy fix. I take it out and replace it. Digital board part goes irate and back to the shop for that piece of junk for a replacement. I get to mix and match to find the \"better quality\" in my analog board and its completely mine all for the same price as those digital boards. \"A professional is always prepared. Or, you could get better glasses, or a digial mixer with a large screen and knob capacity...\" Ok now. Sometimes you cant be prepared when your boss or manager or whoever is in charge(unless its yourself then your to blame) doesn't allow you to prep for said upcoming gig. As for the bigger screen. Ok you can maybe if the brand allows it to add on a bigger screen, that does not address the problem of flipping through the pages within the board. When a mic is feeding back or my channel is not responding I dont want to be flipping trough pages and buttons to fix the problem, by then it could be to late, oh damn there goes my speaker. It just blew up because I couldnt mute or turn down my channel or mic down quick enough. Last off the actual knob problem and there not being enough is not something to be remedied by buying more knobs. That just how they're built, the companys wanted a \"do it all\" function on these boards so there's only a handful of knobs and twisty go bobs to make it tight and compact. In which, like I said, does not allow for quick and efficient adjustments. \"Don't let unassociated people screw with your equipment.\" Thats the biz man. A band walks into the bar and they need reinforcement, you can't just tell them no. Most sound techs should trust their fellow sound guy to use and handle the equipment. But there's always that one slip up that can send you to the ground. Hell the actual owner of the board can reset the thing if he/she wasn't paying close enough attention and accidentally hit a button. In which with analog, if you hit a button the worse that can happen is you mute a channel or turn off the board, in which case you turn it back on or un-mute the channel. Simple and easy. So yes simple is better. Honestly you should strive to work smarter not harder. So once again is simple is better, in this case..."

            "text": "First of all I would like to start off by saying that there was no time limit given for the resolution to take place in. I am arguing that we should begin expanding to colonize Mars. Rome wasn't built in a day. C1) Your time argument can be countered in two parts: a) There was no time limit given for the resolution so technically this project could take place over an infinite amount of time. The resolution states that the US Federal Government should expand to colonize Mars, which I will defend but this does not have to happen now. b) Rome wasn't built in a day. Should Columbus have given up when he first reached North America? \"It'll take too long to settle this giant new land, we should just not even try.\" This argument is fallacy. Just because something will take a while doesn't mean that the endevor shouldn't be undertaken. C2) Yes, right now the economy isn't doing so hot but that doesn't mean this project can't be started. Right now the US could start planning, budgeting, confering with experts on the idea to start putting a plan together. By the time any significant tests or building can start there will be a good chance that the economy will be back up and running properly. The GDP grew 2.5% in Q3 2011 [1] which isn't great but its better than nothing. By the time this project can get off the ground. Start off slow and let the idea gain momentum over time as the economy progresses and gets better. C3) By the time we need to put people into space the economy should be back on its feet and cost shouldn't be that big of an issue. Even if it is this would be a cost put up in the name science. The International Space Station (ISS) cost NASA roughly $35 billion dollars [2]. If NASA and the American public were willing to blow $35 billion on a space station they will be more than willing to pay equal to or more to start up a Marsian colonization project. While the costs are a little high all new technologies have high start up costs. C4) \"Although Biosphere II has been correctly criticized on scientific grounds, it was a remarkable engineering achievement and provides some confidence that self sustaining biospheres can be built for space settlements.\" Essentially you countered your own argument. With improved technology and a team of scientific experts (the same department who put men on the moon and invented Tang) a biosphere, which has already been proven to be a viable field of study, moves into the realm of plausible and then even probable. Now, once we get the biosphere system working it could sustain the first settlers while they get the ground work laid for a permenant settlement on Mars through a process known as terraforming. terraforming - (literally, \"Earth-shaping\") of a planet, moon, or other body is the hypothetical process of deliberately modifying its atmosphere, temperature, surface topography or ecology to be similar to the biosphere of Earth, in order to make it habitable by Earthlings. [3] Terraforming Mars Terraforming Mars would be a slow and steady process but a process that can be achieved. Mars's atmosphere is 95% CO2 [4] making it condusive to plant respiration. Now if we managed to dig an artificial lake and fill it with enough salt water as not to freeze, perhaps by putting it under a dome of some sort, we could introduce a type of algae or plant that can survive in such atmospheric conditions. Then we expand this process to include more and more plants. Slowly, ever so slowly the atmosphere of Mars will begin to stabilize to sustain life. Other ways to help sustain atmosphere: Large orbital mirrors that will reflect sunlight and heat the Mars surface. Greenhouse gas-producing factories to trap solar radiation. Smashing ammonia-heavy asteroids into the planet to raise the greenhouse gas level \"NASA is currently working on a solar sail propulsion system that would use large reflective mirrors to harness the sun's radiation to propel spacecraft through space. Another use for these large mirrors would be to place them a couple hundred thousand miles from Mars and use the mirrors to reflect the sun's radiation and heat the Martian surface. Scientists have proposed building mylar mirrors that would have a diameter of 250 km (155.34 miles) and cover an area larger than Lake Michigan. These gigantic mirrors would weigh about 200,000 tons, which means they would be far too large to launch from Earth. However, there is the possibility that the mirrors could be constructed from material found in space.If a mirror this size were to be directed at Mars, it could raise the surface temperature of a small area by a few degrees. The idea would be to concentrate the mirrors on the polar caps to melt the ice and release the carbon dioxide that are believed to be trapped inside the ice. Over a period of many years, the rise in temperature would release greenhouse gases, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which you can find in your air conditioner or refrigerator.\" [4] So as you can see, Mars cannot support life NOW but in the future, its completely possible. With a thickened atmosphere radiation would be stopped, temperatures would rise and gas levels would equilize allowing life to be able to slowly evolve and grow. C5) The Earth may not be over populated now however UN predictions put the world in a dire situation in years to come. 2050: 10.6 billion 2300: 36 billion [5, pg 26] As you can see, while the Earth may not be in immidiete danger of overcrowding and overpopulation the threat is certainly real in the long run and cannot be overlooked. By the time this project becomes feasible the world will indeed be, by our standars, overcrowed and overpopulated. Other poptential benefits of colonizing Mars: * mineral resources - mining * new frontier for exploration, inovation and developement * an area for people to expand to preventing wars and overcrowding * opens the door to future extraterrestrial colonization While this project cannot happen overnight it is something that can be attained. In order to further humanity, combat future threats to our planet and our race it would be beneficial and in the spirit of man to expand to Mars and colonize something outside of our own realm.

I cannot figure a cost because there is no cost to compare this to, its completely new ground. It will be in the billions I can tell you that but it will be over time. The economy will grow with this program, I think you missed that point. - No the ISS cost I gave you was the US cost alone. Also, who says that the US government can't work with other nations? If something like this happened it would certainly be a joint effort. The US government would start it in accordance to the resolution but it never says anything about functioning alone. - It was a breakthrough, once again you make my argument for me \"they knew what went wrong\" you say. The reason why they never fixed it is because there was no need to at the time. With a project like the colonization of Mars, with a team of experts working on the problem they will be able to fix it in a way that can support life on Mars. Next you say \"with terraforming not working\", when you have given no evidence that this would not work. In fact I think given enough time and science it would work quite well. Please expand this point. - While the entire population might be able to fit in Texas that would not be healthy nor comfortable. That would destroy the land and in turn destroy sustainibility for such a population. I could probably fit about 500 fish in my fishtank too but they wouldn't survive very long. Just because something fits doesn't mean it can surviv or function. - Once again you base your argument off of today's technology, but in the future mining other planets will be possible. With lower gravity on Mars (1/3 Earth gravity) mining would actually be easier than it is here. There have been studies showing how shooting a rock or rod at a surface could blow a crater out to help speed the mining process or prospect for new metals. Mining can be done off of Earth and will be done on Mars. \"Outer Space treaty of 67\" --- source please, or expand. Also treaties can be rewritten and reworked quite easily. But until you source this claim I cannot refute any further. - I addressed radiation through my terraforming argument. Once an atmosphere begins to stabilize and develope it will begin to absorb more and more radiation thus neutralizing the problem. Until then it would be no matter to build a biodome out of radiation resistent glass. \"no sex in space\" \"messed up babies\" These are random jumbles that are not coherent nor relevent. Expand and I might be able to address this. --- Your move ---"

            "text": "-- My Case -- A. Potential Mars has infinitely more potential than Antarctica. The surface area of Mars is roughly 28% of the Earth's, however since there is no oceans on Mars this would nearly double the usable dry land for humanity. [1] Also, there is an innumerable amount of resources on Mars that humans could use. Everything from deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen used for nuclear fusion, to platinum, gold, silver and iron. [2] Considering we have an entire planet to mine and exploit the potential for humanity is mind numbing. In fact, this possibility is not far off. While a colony now could not be self sufficient (no colony is when they first start, including colonies here on Earth), the technology to erect shelter, mine, grow food in greenhouses and store air and water is not impossible. In time, with continued effort and growth a colony on Mars would be possible and perhaps even self sufficient giving humanity a second world to inhabit. Contrast this infinite potential for growth, exploration and human development to Antarctica. There is nothing for humanity in Antarctica that requires colonization. While Mars could be turned into a viable place to live with effort and time, Antarctica simply cannot be. The potential to terraform Mars is a technological possibility while you will never be able to change the climate of the South Pole. It will always be cold and windy and if it isn't then the ocean levels will rise with the melting of the poles. The few humans we have in Antarctica is plenty and might even be too much. a) Example Take for example the British Empire, they have the option of colonizing a tiny barren rocky island off the coast of Britain or they can invest and wait and strive for colonizing America. Obviously, the choice they want is America. The only good argument that can be made for colonizing the barren island is that it's closer or easier. Neither are very good arguments when looking at a vast wealthy new land such as America. -- My Opponent's Case Refuted -- Much like in my example, Pro's case simply is that it's easier. He simply claims colonizing Antarctica is \"cheaper\" and then makes a weak argument that colonizing Mars is \"generations\" away. I'd like to point out that say we took all the money, infrastructure, willpower and time we'd put into colonizing Antarctica (which would be a lot considering the climate and locale) into creating a program to establish a small colony on Mars and I think we wouldn't be far off. Generations is a big word. We said we'd go to the moon in 10 years and guess what, we did it and we did it when no American had ever been to space before. Also, my opponent basically admits that a colony in Antarctica might not be self sufficient by saying \"they'd be able to receive help if needed\". Why have a non self sustaining colony in a barren and difficult part of the world when we can have one on Mars with infinite potential? Also, my opponent mentions coal and water as resources as a reason to colonize. However, as I already pointed out, Mars has the potential to have rarer isotopes for power, silver, gold, platinum and even some water of it's own. [2] If we want to colonize a difficult place for resources, Mars is the place to focus. -- Conclusion -- When you compare the two places, the potential of Mars far outstrips the potential of Antarctica. The only good reason for colonizing Antarctica first is that it's easier. But we'd get little to no benefit from colonizing there so why bother? Why not colonize the North Pole and the barren rocks in the South Atlantic while we're at it just because it's possible. Possibility does not equal practicality. Therefore, Antarctica should not be colonized at all and future colonization efforts should be focused on Mars for its vast potential. [1] http://www.universetoday.com...

Please clarify with me in your response if you meant to reference the golf-like sport of \"Croquet\", rather than your spelling of \"Krokae\". Yes, I do agree. If, golf is not a sport, then most of these \"sports\" should be removed from the list as well, which I believe they should. These \"sports\", much like golf, require little physical strain, training, or duress. Some of them even lack the concept of competition (fishing, hunting). What burns me up the most about this \"sport\" is how the media overhypes it. You can't turn on the TV without seeing an ad for the PGA Tour, the triumphs and tragedies of Tiger Woods, and the ridiculous amounts of money they earn by knocking a white ball into a hole. I can tolerate (to a point) the \"sports\" you referenced being referred to as \"sports\" mainly because they are avoided by the media, for the purpose that some take these \"sports\" as low thrill, leading to little interest. What sickens me the most is that the media has allowed golf to stand out among these hobbies. And heaven forbid that the \"gentleman's sport\" of golf goes down in history, right in there with baseball, as a great American pastime. Golf is not a sport."

Definition of a scientific theory [7]: \"A coherent group of tested general propositions, commonly regarded as correct, that can be used as principles of explanation and prediction for a class of phenomena\" When Dimitropoulou spoke of his theory, he meant that it was the most likely answer. Does Pro not believe the theory of relativity or quantum theory? \"The article assumes because of the masturbation, but this is highly debatable\" I sincerely doubt that the National Institute of Health would publish inconclusive data. Scientists know how to account for error in the data. Also, the white blood cell count should have gone down, not up, after ejaculation if stress was causing the high blood cell count. Masturbation works against stress. I believe that argument by Pro was a way to dodge conceding an argument. They were also not checking just the semen for increased white blood cells, they were checking the blood of these men as well. --------------------------------------------------------- I'm not completely sure if I'm allowed to respond to Pro's round 4 argument, but there are so many straw men that he set up that I don't care if I have to lose the conduct point. Straw Man #1: \"But you did have the chance in round two to make your arguments of why you believe porn is good\" My argument is not to show that porn is good. It is to show that is not harmful to one's health. Straw Man #2: \"Con, did you even look at the article? The study was done by Cambridge University. Cambridge University is a very well known University.\" I'm not going to read the article, it's up to Pro to make the arguments. Also, my statement had nothing to with the way the brain reacts. My statement was referring to the side-effects of over masturbation v. alcoholism. They're not anywhere close in magnitude. Straw Man #3: So if I look at porn and masturbate once per day I will be fine? I don't think so. As stated porn and masturbation causes a release in dopamine. This is a complete misrepresentation of my argument. I was pointing out that anything in excess is bad, be it water, salad, or masturbation. One cannot drown themselves, and then claim water is unhealthy. Straw Man #4: I didn't say that dopamine is unnatural in the brain, but that UNNATURAL LEVELS of dopamine within the brain is a bad thing. I was stating that there cannot be unnatural levels of something that is created naturally. Your brain cannot create an unnatural amount of anything, because as long as the brain is making it, it is a natural level. Straw Man #5: Con has conceded that losing dopamine receptors is not good, but I don't believe he fully understands how dopamine works in the brain, and why losing these receptors is a very bad idea. I conceded something completely unrelated to the resolution. Again, losing dopamine receptors is not good, but it's not necessarily harmful. The resolution is that porn and masturbation are definitively harmful to overall health. (Jumping from straw men to outright mistruths) \"I have stated that masturbation can cause penile shrinkage as the study points out\" This is not what Pro stated. Pro stated that \"masturbation can cause damage, and penile shrinkage (round 2).\" The resolution is that masturbation definitively harms the body, leaving the possibility that it might not harm the body is a concession. (Pro has asked a question that I will address) \"How is my personal story unrelated to the resolution stated?\" The story is unrelated to the resolution because Pro has failed to connect how his overall health has been harmed by porn and masturbation. ------------ I believe that I have successfully made the case for why pornography and porn are not necessarily harmful. Yes excessive masturbation may be bad, but as I proved, excessive anything is bad. Thanks for a fun debate. I learned a lot more about the topic than I knew going into it.

PORN USERS HAVE SAME EFFECT AS AN ALCOHOLIC Studies at Cambridge University have shown people who are addicted to pornography show similar brain activity to alcoholics or drug addicts. MRI scans of test subjects who admitted to compulsive pornography use, showed that the reward center of the brain (ventral striatum) reacted to seeing explicit material in the same way as an alcoholic might on seeing a drink. http://www.independent.co.uk... http://www.lifesitenews.com... PORN CAUSES UNNATURAL LEVELS OF DOPAMINE IN BRAIN Porn physically changes our brains' for the worse. Just like other addictive substances, porn floods the brain with dopamine (pleasure hormone). When our brain gets overwhelmed by the constant levels of dopamine that comes with consistent porn use, it fights back by taking away some of its dopamine receptors which hear dopamine\u2019s message. Since there are now fewer receptors, even if the brain is putting off the same levels of dopamine in response to porn, the user will not feel dopamine\u2019s effect as much. Because of this, the porn they were looking at before doesn\u2019t seem as arousing or exciting, and the porn user has to go hunting for more porn or more hardcore porn to get the effect the old porn used to offer.

Journal of Adolescent Health 27, 2: 41\u201344. PORN CAUSES P.I.E.D (PORN INDUCED ERECTION DISFUNCTION) According to Dr. Elizabeth Waterman, psychologist at Morningside Recovery Center, \"When people start watching porn, there is a huge flood of dopamine in the brain,\" Because of high dopamine levels, the receptors that were once very sensitive become less sensitive, and normal physical intimacy does not produce enough dopamine to stimulate the dopamine receptors. The more porn someone watches, the more, and harder and more graphic, porn you need in order to get an erection. If the user continues, they can find themselves physically unable to maintain an erection, much less enjoy sexual contact with another person. http://www.mensjournal.com...

MASTURBATION CAN CAUSE DAMAGE, AND PENILE SHRINKAGE Dr. Irwin Goldstein, director of medicine at Alvarado Hospital, believe penile shrinkage occurs because of two main causes: 1. By the buildup of plaque, known as fat, that prevents the flow of blood, 2. By the buildup of inelastic scar tissue that prevents arteries from increasing in size inside the fibrous sheath of the erectile chambers. Excessive and abusive masturbation can damage the various subcutaneous tissues of the penis, causing both a buildup of plaque and an increase in scar tissue, two issues seen in a similar condition known as peyronie\u2019s disease. The sexually exhausted body can also experience an inhibited liver production and a depletion of HGH, an essential growth hormone for penile tissues, thus a male will experience penis shrinkage. http://www.herballove.com... PERSONAL PORN STORY I know many readers will most likely blow this part off, but I believe personal experience is powerful in a debate as well. I started masturbating, like most guys, around the age of 15-16, and I loved the feeling I received from it (dopamine release). Some I became bored of just masturbating, so I turned to porn videos to provide me more images I could use to get me a better session. I soon became addicted to the dopamine release, and pleasure I was getting each day. Now at age 38, I find it hard to get an erection when having sex with my wife, and need to think of the images in order to stay hard. Porn has ruined my sex life, and I am struggling now to break free, and get me life back in regular order."

The religious texts read, they're just written by people who are self acclaimed to be inspired by god. Does this mean I could write a book and say it's inspired by a god and it means that it's not from the human mind but actually written by god? And the contents of the book are from god? Also, if the father isn't a real guy, and is just a spirit, then how is it not created by the human mind? Things either exist physically or mentally, so since god isn't physical, he is mental. He exists in our heads and that can't be argued. Religion is a mindset that helps people have something to follow, something to feel good about. People feel that if they don't follow a religion they're bad people, because nobody has ever praised an atheist for being an atheist! But once someone finds god, they're praised by all of the others who have found god and have decided that religion isn't a mental thing but just exists somewhere. No, religion is nothing but a mindset to help those who are scared of death and the afterlife, find something to believe in and have faith in.

            "text": "This debate is over the validity of Ludwig Feuerbach's Theory of Religion given in his work, \"The Essence of Christianity.\" Feuerbach subjects his own theory to questioning in his explanation. Feuerbach's General Thesis of Religion is as follows: 1. All religion is egoistic - arises out of and focuses on human needs and concerns 2. Originally, religion personified forces of nature. They became Gods - and humans relate to these with both a feeling of fear and love. Monotheistic religion began when humans became aware of their difference from other parts of nature - when humans began to develop self-consciousness - then self-consciousness embodied the idea of God. Feuerbach's Thesis on Monotheistic Religion is as follows: 1. The value of religious ideas lies in the truth they can reveal to us - the truth of our own human potential - this is revealed in the idea of God. - This idea has 3 functions: a. to express our self-consciousness b. to clarify our self- consciousness c. to inspire us to reach our human potential 2. The problem with religion lies in the falsehood it promotes - belief in the existence of God as a real being distinct from humans - causing us to lose touch with our human potential expressed in the idea of God, and causing us to lose motivation to achieve out potential. Feuerbach then states several \"proofs\" for his thesis: First proof: 1. Religion (and the idea of God it gives us) is unique to humans. 2. Therefore, religion must arise from some trait unique to humans. 3. That unique trait is self-consciousness 4. Therefore, religion (and the idea of God it gives us) must arise from human self-consciousness. Clarification of terms: A Is a necessary condition of B If B cannot exist or occur without A. A is a sufficient condition of B if A alone is enough to produce B. Self- consciousness is a sufficient condition of the awareness of God, but perhaps only succeeds in showing it is a necessary condition. STOP: I would like to pause for a second here at the end of Feuerbach's first proof to shed light on the falsehood of his points. First, I would like to play devil's advocate and give attention to a somewhat mysterious topic. Religion is defined as the worship of a controlling force greater than or superior to oneself. A dog worships and obeys his master because his master controls his food source and in essence, his life. Would it be correct, by definition, then to say that the dog is religious? Yes, it would, though not in the terms we traditionally like to refer to. So, it is important to understand that the concept of religion - the worship and obedience to a higher power - is NOT restricted to humans alone. Simply, the definition to human thought. Thus, all of the following points are null and void. However, to gain further evidence I will continue. Secondly, Feuerbach's third point in his first proof supporting his thesis should also be evaluated. Recently, an article by national geographic indicated that animals such as elephants, dolphins, magpies, and some great apes were capable of self-recognition which could indicate a deeper level of self-consciousness. Therefore, this trait has a large possibility of not being unique to human beings. Thus, point 4 is deemed void. The least \"humanized\" version of the definition of God is \"a person or thing of supreme value.\" So, it might be correct to say that to a dog, a human is God. There is more to this argument but I would like to allow the Pro/For speaker to have a chance to speak on the first proof before i continue into the second one. --------------------------------- CITED --------------------------------------------- 1. http://news.nationalgeographic.com... 2. https://www.merriam-webster.com... 3. https://www.merriam-webster.com... 4.

Tribal religions existed long before today's modern monotheistic religions. Also, I would like to point out that you gave no means of justifying your argument. Considering that while you don't believe that God is a physical being others may say that God - if taken in human form (Jesus) was real, then he does exist physically. Someone could also argue that it is scientifically supported that human beings have souls or spirits and as such one could recognize the spirit of God as a physical element of life. Setting aside personal opinions of religion, is Ludwig Feuerbach's Theory of Religion valid? The answer is No because of the format and content of his proofs. Since I have no more to counter your opinion - not really an argument - on Ludwig Feuerbach's Theory of Religion, I will continue on to his second proof: His second proof is as follows: The only way we could form a concept of a perfect being would be to reflect on what we admire as the perfect aspects of human existence. (This implies that the reality of God depends on our way of perceiving. It is important to note that there are several religious objections and a few of them are worth mentioning. It is also important to note Feuerbach's responses to these objections. All of which are as follows: - Religious Objection to Feuerbach's second proof: There could be more to God than what our idea of God describes. THE reality of God does not depend on our way of understanding. The more radical form of this argument has been called the \"via negativa\" (way of negation) this says that the only way to approach the knowledge of God is to deny any assumed characteristics of God. -Feuerbach's response to the religious objection: To adopt this position undermines the purpose of belief in God, because via negativa results in a God who is meaningless in everyday life. (Here, I would like to give credit to Feuerbach because this counter argument is valid in all rights.) - Less radical form of religious objection says there is some truth to our human descriptions of God - it's not necessary to negate the predicates of God but these don't capture the entire reality of God. There may be more to God than we can know. (Here, I would like to state that this is what the majority of people would claim as a religious objection.) - Feuerbach's response: If we only know of God in terms drawn from human existence, then we have no grounds for saying God is more than this. (Here, I would like to say that if the claim that God transcends all human knowledge is true then there are grounds for saying that God has the potential to be more than this. Also, we can only use so much of our brains - how are we to know that these are the only terms of human existence?) - The last religious objection relies on the faith of the believer. - Feuerbach's response: Faith does not prove the existence of God - it only tells us what we want to be true - it reveals our nature to us not God's Nature. That is the end of his second proof and it is where I would like to begin my analysis. Firstly, Feuerbach claims that \"Faith only tells us what we want to be true.\" If that is the case then Feuerbach just debunked his entire theory in one statement. Feuerbach referenced us to human self-consciousness in the beginning of his first proof. Feuerbach's assumption and the implication were that human self-consciousness was an advanced trait that we evolved into. Feuerbach was relying on his own faith in human evolution and denied the possibility that human self-consciousness could have been created within us by the design of God. Feuerbach had no scientific evidence to back up this implication considering his book entitled \"The essence of Christianity\" was written in 1841 and Darwins book \"The Origin of Species\" was published in 1859. Darwin's work was the first major contributor to this THEORY. So, Feuerbach - having no scientific evidence to back up his assumption that human self-consciousness derivative of the human mind and not blessed upon us by a divine power was in and of itself, a faith. Which as Feuerbach says: \"does not prove the existence\" of an evolutionized human self-consciousness but simply tells us what he \"wants to be true.\" Between the content of his proofs being false and/or questionable and the format that he follows in supporting his proofs, he negates himself and proves his theory invalid. Remember this was not a debate on whether what he said was true or not but in the validity of his argument. (Though, I believe that he fails in both categories.) -------------------------CITED------------------------------ 1. https://www.psychologytoday.com... 2.

            "text": "Economics My opponent claims Europeans utilizing this technology is not the same as America. If anything, it is harder in Europe. Europe has a much more restricted economy, implying its success should be less likely. The fact is survives here shows the reasons it fail here are irrelevant to the entire situation. Solar panels continue, when using the normal (silicon) platform are competitive with fossil fuels. Solyndra used a more expensive hybrid, which is not even used in solar roads\u2014and my opponent ignored that point of the argument\u2014making solyndra itself irrelevant. Further, companies in Arizona have utilized the same solyndra platform and have found ways to make the more efficient technology cheaper than previously. If anything, the death of solyndra has caused other smaller companies to make the technology even better, making it a very practical power source. Solyndras technology, now being improved since its collapse (and is thriving) merely shows how solyndra is anecdotal evidence [1. http://www.scientificamerican.com...] My opponent then cites another anecdotal evidence piece, Abound Solar. The loan, while being $400 million, was actually $70 million (only $70 million have been given by the time of its closing). Abound Solar was an extremely small company whose focus was inventing new PV solar panels. The fact a small company went bankrupt attempting to take on a large task isn\u2019t surprising. The reason Abound went out of business was not that solar panels fail, it was because they succeed. The Energy Department wrote, \u201c[w]hen the floor fell out on the price of solar panels, Abound\u2019s product was no longer cost competitive.\u201d [2. http://energy.gov...] Although Abound was making more efficient technology, the traditional (and improving) PV technology of other, larger, companies forced the small company to lose money. It was not \u201csolar panels suck, so we went bankrupt\u201d, as my opponent claims, it was that solar power became too cheap for Abound. The reason Abound went out of business is because solar power got cheaper, not because it is bad. My opponents cost comparisons are flawed, mainly because asphalt road costs do not include the power needed to create the asphalt, its transportation, etc. Further, solar roads save money through lighting of the streets at night and, well, everything else. Those costs benefits have not been factored in with solar roads. If they were added, the costs would fall substantially [3. http://www.solarroadways.com...]. Indeed, current roads cost $28.7 billion in 2010 \u2013 and that is only federal costs [4. http://www.artba.org...]. In other words, solar roads costs about 6.5 times less than federal road spending currently. Since solar power creates energy, and therefore has a benefit to it, solar power will substantially lower costs. My opponents study was about solar power for houses. Now, the study was not about roads. Solar roads, as stated, last to 30 years whereas asphalt lasts to seven years. My source three notes, \u201cAt today's price of 12\u00a2/kWh, a Solar Road Panel would have to generate 10,000/0.12 = 83,333 kWh of electricity over 20 years to pay off its initial cost. That's a worst case scenario: assuming that the price of electricity doesn't increase over the next 20 years (we know it will!).\u201d[3] This fact notes in less than one lifetime it pays itself off, and this means there are ten years where solar roads generate revenue. And, again, that analysis is a conservative one. My opponents second source is a broken link, like most of his sources, making it very, very irritating to understand what he is trying to say as he has not elaborated much at all. Solar roads are like a car. Sure, a diesel is more expensive than a normal car, but the extra gas mileage will pay for itself. (just like solar) 2. Jellyfish My opponent seems to not understand how discoveries work or my argument. I said that it is an assumption that they would be used, not that they work. Not once did I say jellyfish would not be a source of power. I merely noted it is full speculation that these will actually be implemented in commercial use. When a discovery is, well, discovered, it is generally in a lab. There are many solar panels in labs which are not currently in civilian or commercial hands. There is no reason to think the jellyfish method will come into use for a simple reason: it was created because solar power was costly. But, as stated, recent developments in technology have lowered solar costs which make the Jellyfish idea obsolete in the modern debate. 3. Environment My opponent must have skipped my argument here. I did not drop anything. I will say again: I DID NOT DROP ANYTHING. My opponent said this: Wind is good Hydro is good Solar has Co2, so it sucks But I extensively refuted this. I noted (1) the life cycle of wind versus solar roads would make it so winds construction costs would increase the amount of CO2 assumed by my opponent. Solar roads = 40 years, wind = 10 years lifetime. I cited statistics that solar emits 0.8 pounds of Co2 per kilowatt hour, and wind 0.04. So, to make the comparison fair, 30 vs 30, we need three wind cycles. 0.04 + 0.04 + 0.04 = .12, therefore wind actually emits more. (2) I noted how Hydro power often had a large amount of Co2 emissions, sometimes even more than coal due to construction and maintenance, and coal is much worse than solar in that respect. Indeed, even though the EPA does not add construction (or maintenance) to their analysis they still agree that Hydro emits large amounts of methane to the atmosphere [5. http://www.epa.gov...]. I directly refuted my opponents analysis, and I added a little bit here, I do not see how I dropped anything. CONCLUSION 1. Solar is becoming economically efficient, and is competing with fossil fuels. 2. Solar roads are at first expensive, but after 20 years (probably less) they will begin running a profit 3. Solar roads, only covering 1% of our highways, would fuel our entire energy needs 4."

            "text": "Economics We can both agree that the Euro economy is alot worse then the American economy, but the matter of the fact is why are solar pannel companies succeeding in Europe but failing in America? The answer is obvious and that is America is not ready for this kind of technology and this is where geographics come into play. That is the span of land that it covers. You see currently in Europe the High Speed Rail industry is highly succeeding, but in America it is failing. http://www.nytimes.com...'s that you may ask? That is due to the fact that America is just to big compared to Europe and the same goes to renewable energy. The US is bigger and the renewable energy is just to little to supply America as we've already seen. Plus to make things worse is that it doesn't substain now what makes us think that in the future, when our energy needs will increase by 25% by 2040, that we will be able to supply the whole US. I also never stated that the loan was $400 million, what I stated was that the loan had reached up to $535 million and the company still failed! Plus you're going to have to take my word on this because of the fact that I have a source (round 3) and he doesn't. High cost estimates and no reason why highways key Alter 9 (Lloyd Alter, Infrastructurist on Solar Roadway: FAIL, http://www.treehugger.com..., 9/22/09, Accessed 7/13/12, KW) Solar Roadways is engineering PV panels to withstand 40-ton vehicles going 80 miles an hour over them day and night for decades. How much more does it cost to make solar panels-already a bit pricey-totally indestructible? We're guessing a lot. And this all so we can avoid putting them someplace sensible, like on all those empty rooftops in America's sunnier climes, where cars and trucks don't drive and where there also happens to be an existing electrical grid for them to hook into. No Solvency\u2014cost, strength, repair and reliability Science Channel 11 (from the website \u201cCuriosity?\u201d, an online educational site sponsored by the Discovery Channel, http://curiosity.discovery.com.... Noparstak) A U.S. company called Solar Roadways has designed a model for highways that are themselves made of solar panels. Some wonder whether is it feasible to use the highways to produce solar energy. The following are some major concerns: Cost - - Each solar panel costs almost $7,000 to build, and the plan would require billions of solar panels to cover the world's highways [source: The Telegraph]. In the current situation, the expense makes the plan impractical. Strength - - The proposed solar panels would be built to withstand the weight of heavy vehicles, but we do not understand the full extent of their durability. If the solar panels get damaged, the traffic signals could fail, thereby compromising our safety. Repair - - It is much more expensive to repair and upkeep solar panels than standard asphalt. Reliability - - Solar energy becomes unreliable when the weather is cloudy or dark. Costs outweigh the benefits- no return in the short-term Raikar 11(Sudhir, EcoFriend, \u201cThe good, the bad and the ugly: Harnessing solar energy on highways\u201d, http://www.ecofriend.com..., June 16, 2011, Accessed 7/9/12, WITASZEK) Too difficult and costly to implement For all its benefits, the solar panel highways are a costly proposition. While the manufacturing cost of a single panel is about $7,000, the plan of laying them on the highway expanse would mean a financial loss of billions. Apart from the installation cost, implementation training, and maintenance would create major cost chunks. It would easily take several years before the return on investments would cover the costs incurred. Precisely, this is the reason why the company is hinting at small-scale projects to start with. Can this be avoided? It's clear that repairs and maintenance of these solar panels is much higher as compared to fixing on normal asphalt roads. 2. Jellyfish My opponent is ignoring the arguement here and as I brought up earlier that solar roads will and have to use jellyfish proteins and we end up getting the huge disadvantage that I brought up. But if you still need more proof then I had already given you then I guess here's some more. Scientists use jellyfish to produce solar panels because it\u2019s inexpensive and there is a large supply of jellyfish now Dillow 10 (Clay, writer and editor for POPSCI, Swedish Researchers Harness Green Goo to Create Solar Cells from Jellyfish, Sept 7 2010, http://www.popsci.com.... Noparstak) A group of Swedish researchers are looking beyond plants for living models upon which to base their solar harvesting tech, turning instead to the photovoltaic prowess of the jellyfish. Tapping a protein in the jellyfish Aequorea victoria known as green fluorescent protein (GFP), the team has assembled a device that converts ultraviolet light into free electrons using a drop of green goo. The team assembled its cell from two simple aluminum electrodes separated by a small gap atop a silicon dioxide substrate. The GFP is placed between the two electrodes where it assembles itself into strands connecting the electrodes. When introduced to UV light, the GFP gobbles up photons, producing electrons that enter the circuit as electricity. Why GFP? For one, it\u2019s inexpensive. It doesn\u2019t require expensive additives or costly processing, but can go directly onto the substrate where it starts cranking out juice. Further, it can be integrated into a self-contained fuel cell that requires no outside light source. Photons would instead be generated within the fuel cell by enzymes like the ones found in natural light-producers, like fireflies or sea pansies. Such a power source could be miniaturized to power tiny nano-devices. Not to mention, jellyfish are in great supply. Populations are booming in some areas, leading inexplicably to massive jellyfish swarms (the Gulf oil disaster could lead to a spike in jellyfish numbers in those waters). If researchers can harvest something good from all that extra GFP in the water, more power to them. Envirnment My opponent is again ignroing what I brought up about how NF3 is 17000 times more deadly and dangerous than CO2, so at this point I can care less about CO2. By the fact that my opponent is trying to help the envirnment but is his alternative is something that would litterally kill the envirnment and the econsystem this is just horrible. So yet he has said nothing on that matter so you can eaily see that I win this arguement here. Conclusion So at the end of the debate we have to look at the major facts that were made. A. Solar Highways means Jellyfish proteins, which using in excess will collapse the ecosystem. B. Solar Highways emitt NF3 which, as I brought up several times, is 17000 times more powerful than CO2 and more deadly. C. It won't work in the US So you can see here that my opponent is actually trying to destroy the envirnment with this plan and you can stop it with your vote for Con."

            "text": "Benefits of Solar Power Solar power is a renewable (as opposed to fossil fuels) resource which is becoming increasingly popular amongst modern renewable energy sources. On the current path, photovoltaic power (which is what\u2019s used in solar roads) will power 1 \u2013 2 million homes. In 2007, the solar power industry expanded 57%. Not even accounting solar roads, proper investment in these technologies would lead to America\u2019s power source being 80% of the countries power usage at 2020 [1]. An analysis in solar power in Arizona finds \u201cinput/output analysis demonstrates that every $1.00 spent within a community produces about $1.67 of local economic activity. A direct savings of $2.8 - 4.5 million of economic activity for Arizona communities.\u201d[2] New \u201cresearch continues into ways to make the actual solar collecting cells less expensive and more efficient.\u201d[3] Solar power does not emit pollutants. The Energy Information Agency (EIA) notes, \u201cSolar energy systems do not produce air pollutants\u201d, but one problem they note is the fact solar needs \u201ca large surface area \u2026 to collect the energy at a useful rate.\u201d[4] Solar roads do just this. Benefits of solar roads Solar roads are a great way to reduce dependency on fossil fuels. Solar roadways have a much longer lifespan: 30-40 years as opposed to 7 years of conventional asphalt roads. These roads would also lower the usage of power lines and they would be simply placed along the roadway offering efficient and reliable power when most needed during disasters or simply daytime use [5]. Using solar panels with 18% efficiency (though solar panels with 40% efficiency are being created) calculations show solar roads, at only 18% efficiency and an average of 4 hours of daylight, the US could create 20,233 billion Kilowatt hours per year [6]. This amounts to over three times the US energy consumption at the moment (note that three times number was created after subtracting 30% of the total numbers because it would be difficult to angle the solar powers on parking lots and such) [7]. Conclusion I didn\u2019t feel the need to write a long case because it is actually, now that I have thought about it, very hard to oppose solar roads\u2014even if they are only built regionally (i.e. NM, AZ, CA, TX, CO, etc.) because of their countless benefits and the lack of opposing arguments. Let\u2019s see if my opponent will change that. 1. http://www.statesadvancingsolar.org... 2. http://www.azsolarcenter.org... 3. http://www.world-nuclear.org... 4. http://www.eia.gov... 5. http://en.wikipedia.org... 6. http://solarroadways.com... 7.

Now, don't get me wrong I adore the NFL, but there is something about college football that makes it better.\" This debate should involve more than Pro's opinion on the subject. It should include some quotes, statistics, facts, sources, and arguments that establish his side of the debate, but sadly his case is lacking in these elements. If I grant Pro's point that his slight enjoyment advantage for college footbal makes college football better, we could glean a more comprehensive and statistically accurate response if we used poll numbers of a larger sample size spread across the United States of America. When we delve into the poll numbers, it is clear that the result is that Americans overwhelmingly prefer watching NFL football (62%) to college football (38%). [1] Also, when looking at the distributional map for these polling numbers, it is important to note that the states without professional football teams (e.g. West Virginia, Idaho, Oregon) are MUCH more likely to prefer college football (which exists in those states) to professional football in the NFL (which does not exist in those states). [2] \"College Football has a much different feeling than NFL football. It is something a lot of Americans can get into because they may have attended the school they love.\" Today, 30.4 percent of Americans have a bachelors degree. [3] That means that you are limiting this criterion to less than 1/3 of the United States that \"can get into\" college football, because they've attended schools with football programs. Many of those degrees were granted at institutions without college football programs. And even people who have attended universities or colleges with football programs, some of the football programs are notoriously bad, Division II, or Division III, which are really not even worth watching unless they compete for a national or regional title. The reason why NFL football wins this point is because it is something everyone can enjoy whether or not they went to college. Educational achievement is not a limiting factor in NFL football enjoyment or game-day spirit as set up by Pro. \"For me I like the Iowa Hawkeyes because my father attended that school and my entire family is from Iowa, they also root for them as well.\" Iowa also lacks a professional football team, so you are in the statistical minority of people with a higher propensity to root for a college football over a professional team, due to satisfying this condition. \"My point is that it is easier to like a college football team rather than an NFL team because you can say that you attended the school. I myself can say that about the college I will be attending in 2 years. The passion of college football beats the passion of the NFL.\" Again, less than 1/3 of Americans attain bachelor's degrees, and the proportion of Americans who attended schools with good football programs (or football programs at all) is much lower. That's why, for example, I don't cheer for NYU's football team; they don't have one. College is an institution for learning, not a distraction center for worshipping a sports team, which diverts its funds from productive and promising research to encouraging brain disorders in football collisions.

Unlike college football, NFL football is solely focused on just that: football. There are no longer distractions that college campuses distract student-athletes with and no exams that require studying. NFL players live, work, and play for the game itself. \"Most NFL players are bigger than college football players, and this is because they have more time to dedicate to working out. They have trainers and doctors and other professionals on call to help them perfect their minds, bodies, and performance. Additionally, NFL players have access to gyms, other facilities, and products as most college football players do, however more resources go into this for a professional team than most college football teams.\" [2] Contention 2: College Football Should Be Banned College Football, unlike professional football played in the NFL, takes place on university campuses. The primary purpose of university and college campuses is to educate students, not to host football programs, but sadly the emphasis points toward the latter. The net effect of these football programs is to actually decrease funding for other university programs, distract students from their studies, to raise tuition costs, and to contort the meaning of higher education into a worship of football, rather than a preparing of students with knowledge and connections to get them ready for the 21st century American job market and doing high-level research to progress the human species.

            "text": "Your argument is built upon the false narrative I was hoping to dismiss in my first post. Your argument does nothing to prove that AI will take over the world or kill us. As you've said, The best AI created as of now is one that does simple tasks like beat people at chess. What looks like intelligent thought is simply a program whirling away. The program doesn't have a \"goal\" that people just tell it. It doesn't work like that. You have to program the rules of the chess game WITH the goal. The program literally holds the computer's hand through the whole process. If even a single line of code was different, The whole operation would break. With the same chess AI example, Lets say I wanted it to win, But I didn't want it to ever move the queen. You'd simply have the AI programmed to ignore pieces that aren't on the board (which is the only real way to do it so that the AI isn't worrying about pieces that have been captured already! ). The same idea applies to a generally intelligent AI. If you don't want it to kill people while it pursues it's goal, Then simply program that in. Unlike with humans, Where we feel empathy and have morals which could be ignored depending on the situation, An AI programmed not to kill will NOT kill under any circumstance. Depending on the AI, The way it's programmed in may be different, But all the same. Lets go to your IQ. IQ to an AI is MASSIVELY different than an IQ of a human. If people had the processing capabilities of computers, We could smash most IQ tests out of the water. The sharpness of the brain and ability to problem solve is what determines our IQ. For an AI, Problem solving skills have been programmed in and it has the ability to process data faster than we could ever. However, No matter how much it can do, It'll never understand what it's doing. It doesn't have consciousness. If you saw the programming behind the scenes, You'd probably say it could never become consciousness. Imagine if every time you wanted an AI to write on a paper, There were literally mathematical calculations for the hand movements, With predefined movement patterns for the alphabet, And it was waiting for you to input what it should write so it's now on standby (probably running on some general timer that if input takes to long to be received for mediocre tasks, It abandons the task). Even if the AI had such a high IQ, It wouldn't mean they could control every atom, They don't have the tools to do it or learn how to do it. For example, I know how to code, That doesn't mean I can code a working program without a computer to run it on. Moreover, If I NEVER had access to a computer, I would never have been able to learn programming at all. My IQ is > 130, But without having the tools to actually do the job and learn how coding works, I can't just know it because of a high IQ. AI doesn't understand what it's doing. It's simply following a set of programming. If I tell it to kill people in a war wearing specific clothing, That's all it'll do. I could even tell it how long it should be doing that. Without consciousness, An AI simply can't be as intelligent as you think they'll be. They'll always be limited by their programming. That's why programming them is difficult work. You need a series of algorithms for what to use are simple tasks. Then for a learning AI, Those algorithms need to be adjustable through input data. And to do that, Not only do you have the task of making such a complex algorithm, You also have to find ways that an AI can take it solid data like this. For a computer, It doesn't understand vagueness. Everything is black and white, 0 or a 1. You tell it not to kill, There's nothing it could possibly do that would involve killing. You tell it to kill in certain conditions, It'll ONLY kill if those conditions are met COMPLETELY, Otherwise the thought wouldn't even cross it's mind. The reason people think AI will kill humans is because you find some logical path between a task and killing people. To delete spam, For example, You should kill the spammers. However, A logical connection like that is probably one of the hardest things to get an AI to ever do. If you don't program this logical connection, It'll never make it for itself. An AI also will never see the world as a 4 year old. A four year old's understanding is already far too complex and vague to be captured by algorithms. There's also a fallacy in your argument. As IQ increases, The harder it is to get your IQ to increase. Law of diminishing returns."

Just like a new pair of shoes or a new outfit, many people grow weary and bored of his or her tattoos. Whether it be from the tattoo getting stretched out, a name that was a mistake to put in the first place, or just in an inappropriate location, consequences are suffered. Such consequences to suffer are: not being hired at a job interview, and simply being judged or stereotyped by others. A major consequence for the future is the pain and cost of removing the tattoo, or suffering and having it for a lifetime. It\"s best for high school and college students to wait to get a tattoo because of how it could possibly affect their future. A tattoo is forever, but can be a negative thing because just like the newest trends, it can also be out later. A lot of people forget that just as his or her body changes, any tattoo possessed can altar as well. Not many people can stay in the same shape as when they first get a tattoo, so it could end up stretching, shrinking, or even get distorted from stretch marks. Also, having a tattoo of a former love can also cause major regret if there is a separation. For girls especially, putting a tattoo on a certain location, such as the lower back, chest, or back, can end up giving a bad appearance. Embarrassment from a tattoo showing or not being able to cover it for a special occasion can be a negative. No matter what, whether we like it or not, the people in this world judge which can affect a person\"s future. Many people who have their arms covered with tattoos have to go to interviews in long sleeve shirts to get a better chance of getting the job. Lots of companies believe that having tattoos can be unprofessional and usually get distracted on their appearance instead of the person\"s actual qualities. Thus making it hard to get a job. When some people see others with tattoos they can sometime be stereotyped as low-lives, gangsters, rebels, or (for girls) sluts. Most people judge before even meeting others, and can affect first impressions. Also what kind of tattoos a person gets can also be ignorant regrets. Despite the fact that a person loves their tattoo when first getting it, as time passes they may end up getting sick of it. When surveyed from the article, \"Tattoos Are For a Lifetime\", it clearly stated that after surveying a variety of tattoo collectors, an estimate roughly 50% of the people end up wanting their tattoo removed. Those who actually go through with tattoo removals can end up paying over $10,000 just on a simple yet small tattoo. It usually ends up putting them in debt because they can\"t afford to pay everything back, especially in this country\"s money crisis. Such removal techniques are through extremely painful lasers, dermabrasion (the process in which the skin is sanded) , or even surgical excision (in which the tattoo is surgically removed with a scalpel), or the humility of keeping the tattoo forever. Remember the simple lesson learned as a child, one must think before acting. High school and college students should just wait and really think before getting his or her first tattoo.

Now, I realize that people get tattoos so that someone, or something, can be a part of them forever, but tattoos are not the right way to do that. Why not have a picture of them instead? Or something of theirs that they gave you? There are many ways to cherish a loved one or thing, but tattoos are not the right way to do it. Our bodies are very important and not something to be tampered with. People carelessly get tattoos without thinking about the importance of their bodies. It's not right to damage the nature of our skin for the sake of a memory. If someone wants something to be a part of them forever, there are other ways to do that that are less painful, risky, and, well, more attractive. Why damage your skin permanently with the name of someone when you can wear a necklace with their name? Or carry a picture of them? Additionally, why have that person or thing permanently sewn into your skin when they will always be permanently sewn into your heart? The answer: Don't. There are other ways to show your love other than damaging your skin with tattoos. Secondly, tattoos can be very unattractive. I have seen people completely covered with tattoos, and no offense, but it isn't exactly pleasing to the eye. Why would someone want to ruin their skin like that? Just for a memory? Just to look \"cool?\" There are other ways to remember someone/something, and tattoos are far from \"cool.\" Thirdly, getting a tattoo is risky. When people get a tattoo, they might ask: \"Should I do this?\" \"Will I regret it?\" \"Maybe I should/shouldn't because...\" Now obviously when they get the tattoo they have ignored these questions. But that's the problem: people don't know if they will regret it or not, and they end up finding out when it's too late. (And I think we all know that tattoo removal is a very painful process). Also, when someone gets a tattoo, it comes with the risk of reactions with the skin like redness, warmth, a pus-like drain, allergic reactions. Granulomas, etc. People shouldn't risk these things just for the sake of having a tattoo. Lastly, I would like to address the purpose of people getting a tattoo to express themselves and their individuality. A tattoo will do nothing but damage the nature and beauty that is skin. If people want to show that they are serious and dedicated to their unique personalities, they can achieve this in ways that are less risky, unattractive, and painful. They can paint, write, sing, dance, wear their own art (like a T-shirt or other clothing types), etc. Therefore, tattoos are not necessary to express one's uniqueness. In conclusion, I believe that tattoos are unnecessary due to the fact that they come with too many risks, there are alternatives that meet the need for a tattoo, and they can be very unattractive.

            "text": "Many thanks to PRO for instigating this debate. Arguments Like I have stated before, there are tons and tons of ways you can express yourself. Tattoo's just happen to be a quite popular one. When you say \"limiting their expression\" is not always the case. You have people that have tattoos that draw, that make their own shirts, have a certain dress style, sew, wear necklaces, rings, watches, and so on. Many people express themselves at the same time using many different things so it would be unfair to make that statement. You have also stated that \"the people who think tattoos are the only ways to express themselves is extreme\". Well, we do not personally know that person and it is not our place to assume that is the only way they're expressing themselves. From the sounds of it, you are thinking of limiting people's expression by saying they SHOULD sew it onto their clothing and so on. I feel it would be best if people could express themselves on whatever makes the individual feels the most comfortable doing. Also, many people would much rather have something that literally is shown that they have in their heart, and memory. When they are thinking about whatever it is they had tattooed on them, they can simply just look at the tattoo and feel good instead of using their memory. It is a part of them forever, as long as they're on this earth. I think it is necessary if the person feels it is right for the reasons of getting it. Also, my opponent has chosen a very poor choice of words. She keeps using the word \"desirable\". The definition of desirable: Wanted or wished for as being an attractive, useful, or necessary course of action. So yes, tattoos are indeed desirable, and necessary when the individual wants them. Source: s://lh6.googleusercontent.com...; alt=\"\" width=\"800px;\" height=\"329px;\" /> Rebuttals PRO\u2019S again will be shown in Courier New and mine will be shown in Bold. \u201cWhen I said that, I was stating the reason why I believe that they are unnecessary. I am sorry, I misused my words there. What I meant to say was that there are alternatives to damaging your skin just to show your love for something.\u201d-PRO should have worded it differently so it would be clear and would not contradict what she was saying. \u201cMy viewpoint is that tattoos are unnecessary, yours is that they are. irrelevant.\u201d -Indeed it is relevant, because if my viewpoint was irrelevant, why would we be debating why tattoos are necessary and unnecessary? \u201cThat makes is desirable, not necessary. There are other ways to show deep meanings for things.\u201d-I have shown you the definition and source for the word \u201cdesirable\u201d \"Yes, neither of them mention pain, but neither of them say they are painless, either. If it was painful, of course they wouldn't say so, but if it was painless, they would be more than happy to notify the consumer of that, but they did not. Also, in your source http://www.etsy.com...... , it comes with many, many possible risks if you read the \"Legal Disclaimer.\" So when someone gets a tattoo, they are already risking so much, but then when they want it removed, they risk even more. Why go through the hassle when there are alternatives?\"-There is other options for painless tattoo removals. I have provided the source which it states \"We have the tools and technology to painlessly to remove tattoos when they're no longer wanted. Source:https://www.google.com... \u201cLike I have said numerous times: alternatives. (and if they want to show it in public, they can make their own clothing items, accessories, etc.)\u201d-By not wanting to limit people\u2019s ways to express themselves by saying that, you are discouraging tattoos and saying \u201cthere are others ways to express yourself by getting tattoos. So that is limiting one\u2019s right to choose on what way they want to express themselves. Summary My opponent thinks tattoos are unnecessary. My opponent from the start should have been more specific throughout this debate by what defining what is \"unnecessary\" about tattoos. Either it be just a little tattoo, sleeve tattoos, neck tattoos, tattoos on people's faces, or just all tattoos in general. Most of society sees tattoos as interesting, art, self expression, and unique. If she had been more specific on what is \"unnecessary\" as by either having sleeves and face tattoos most people do in fact find that unnecessary, but most people do find tattoos necessary and the percentage is growing each year. Source: https://www.google.com... Conclusion In conclusion of this final round, I believe why I have proved why tattoos are necessary to the people that feel that it is to the people that want them. I will list them again: Memories, loss of a loved one, religious reasons, tribes, cultures, art, and self expressions. I think I have debated, brought good points, and why tattoos are again necessary to the person that feels that way. People don't NEED tattoos, but if they feel the need for the necessary reason then yes, it is. My opponent sees them just as plainly as unnecessary, but everyone has the right to express themselves, do what they can freely do with their own bodies, and do what they feel is best to keep a memory or expression. They should be limited on what they can do to express themselves. Yes, actions do speak louder than words but self expression and feeling comfortable in your own skin with a tattoo can bring that out in someone and I feel they have that right to do so. This has been a very interesting debate, I would again, like to thank PRO very, very much for this interesting debate. I also believe I provided the appropriate sources, evidence, points, and reasons why people feel them to be necessary. I just wish my opponent could have been more specific on what she meant by \"unnecessary\" I again thank PRO for this time consuming debate. I also give her recognition on performing a great debate. Again, thank you and best of luck."

            "text": "The Macquarie Dictionary defines the term \"climate change\" as- a significant change in the usual climatic conditions especially that thought to be caused by global warming. This 'climate change' can be caused by natural or human induced impacts. The global average temperature has risen by nearly a degree in the past 50 years. Scientists around the world have been recording temperature increases, raised ocean levels and melting of ice caps. All this is evidence that the earth is experiencing a \"climate change\". Many people believe that this change is primarily due to the fact that our CO2 emissions have created more greenhouse gases. They believe that there is a relationship between the rise in temperatures and the rise in CO2 emissions. Data shows an \"association\" between temperature levels and CO2 emissions but does not necessarily prove that increased CO2 levels are the most significant aspect of today\"s climate change. For something complex like the weather system, many scientists are needed to unravel the story behind climate change. While most scientists believe climate change occurs, not all agree on the extent and relevance of human activity as an influence on climate change. While major international climate agencies all emphasise the critical role of CO2 emissions in climate change, others are not so sure. For example, some scientists have conducted research that suggests that temperatures were higher than they are today, during the Roman and Medieval periods. These ancient civilisations would not have emitted CO2 emissions as we do today, so why did their temperatures rise? Temperatures have risen and fallen for a long time. The National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) states that climate change over the longer term is mainly due to the amount of sun energy hitting the Earth. Slight changes in the Earth\"s orbit and changes in sun ray intensity, can alter the temperatures here on Earth. Even so, most scientists still emphasise the role of CO2 emissions in unprecedented, rapid global warming. The frank fact is that climate change cannot be stopped. It is completely natural."

            "text": "Greetings. The arguments you are presenting are common among the left side of the political spectrum over the issue of Global Warming/Climate Change. The negation of this debate will now provide eight points as to why the public has been mislead over the complexities of this issue: 1. The 20th century warming of 1-1.4\"F is within the +/- 5\"F range of the past 3,000 years. A 2003 study by researchers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics shows temperatures from 1000-1100 AD (before fossil fuel use) that are comparable to those from 1900-1990. 2. Rising CO2 levels are a result of global warming, not a cause of it. As temperatures increase, CO2 is released from \"carbon sinks\" such as the oceans or the Arctic tundra. Measurements of ice core samples show that over the last four climactic cycles (past 240,000 years) periods of global warming preceded global increases in CO2. 3. Human releases of CO2 cannot cause climate change as any increases in CO2 are eventually balanced by nature. CO2 gets absorbed by oceans, forests, and other \"carbon sinks\" that increase their biological activity to absorb excess CO2 from the atmosphere. 50% of the CO2 released by the burning of fossil fuels and other human activities, has already been absorbed. 4. Global warming and cooling are caused by fluctuations in the sun's heat (solar forcing), not by the minor greenhouse effect of human-produced gases such as CO2 and methane. Between 1900 and 2000 solar irradiance increased .19%. This increase correlates with the rise in surface temperatures in the US. 5. Due to the inherent unpredictability of climate systems it is impossible to accurately use models to determine future weather. Climate models have been unable to simulate major known features of past climate such as the ice ages or the very warm climates of the Miocene, Eocene, and Cretaceous periods. If models cannot replicate past climate changes they should not be trusted to predict future climate changes. 6. Rising temperatures are caused primarily by water vapor, the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, not by CO2. Water vapor concentrations in the atmosphere are driven by natural storm systems and ocean currents. According to a Mar. 5, 2010 study by researchers at NOAA, water vapor in the stratosphere was responsible for increasing the rate of warming during the 1990s by 30%. 7. The increased hurricane activity over the past decade (1995-2005), including hurricane Katrina, is not the result of human-induced climate change; it is the result of cyclical tropical cyclone patterns, driven primarily by natural ocean currents, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) testimony in the US Senate on Sep. 20, 2005. 8. Deep ocean currents cause climate warming and cooling in long term cycles. The minor greenhouse effect of human produced CO2 pales in comparison. Global cooling from 1940 to the 1970s, and warming from the 1970s to 2008, coincided with fluctuations in ocean currents and cloud cover driven by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) - a naturally occurring rearrangement in atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns."

            "text": "Round four defense \"This argument that a consensus proves anything is preposterous, for a multitude of reasons. Number one, the consensus cited. This consensus reviewed 928 abstracts published in scientific journals. 928 is a somewhat large number, but not large enough to make a point off of, considering that there are hundreds of thousands of scientists in this field in the U.S alone [1]. Number two, consensuses are not reliable arguments, especially in the world of science. Scientists had consensuses on many things that turned out to be wrong, such as that saccharin led to cancer, and that the Sun's energy was a requirement for life. This consensus on climate change could be wrong as well.\" Repcon First my opponent states there are hundreds of thousands of scientists within this field. That may be true, but considering each journal interviews has multiple scientist opinions changes the numbers. Furthermore, science magazine was not the only source I used. Finally, my opponent links to a long article in his/her source #1. My opponent has not met his/her burden of proof by quoting the relevant information. Having me proof a negative, that the information is not within the source would put an unfair burden on me. \"he consensus that humans are causing recent global warming is shared by 90%\u2013100% of publishing climate scientists according to six independent studies by co-authors of this paper. Those results are consistent with the 97% consensus reported by Cook et al (Environ. Res. Lett. 8 024024) based on 11 944 abstracts of research papers\" [5] As seen here there are 11,944 abstracts reviewed in this article. As for the consensus changing, my opponent is correct, that science does come to incorrect conclusions and theories are changed to meet the new information. Despite this, this not a coin flip situation. The probability is very high that the scientists are correct in their current assessment. That man-made global climate change is real. \"In the report I just showed about death rates from weather-related disasters, Indur M. Goklany goes into that exact study, and debunks it, saying that, \"Notably, the contribution of extreme events to the mortality burden for accidental causes of death is also small (at 0.4 percent).\" Saying that we need to double down on climate change because it is .4% of the reason for accidental deaths (Not even a full percentage) is quite ridiculous. Goklany also says that, \"Although the review paper\"s estimates for non-flood related deaths are problematic, if one accepts them as valid, that means that climate change currently accounts for less than 0.3 percent of all global deaths. Accordingly, based on current contributions to the global mortality burden, other public health issues outrank climate change.\" This furthers the point that cracking down on global warming for something so small is preposterous. But even putting the argument aside, it doesn't even fit in with what is supposed to be debated.\" Repcon Even .2% of all global deaths would be a lot. Considering \"5.9 million children under age five died in 2015, 16 000 every day \" [17] .2% of 5.9 million might not seem like a lot percentage wise, yet the absolute number of 11, 800 children under five annually is still high. An analogy would be that homicides involving guns don't make up even the top ten list of all cause mortality. Still, people tend to get upset about these deaths. Furthermore, showing people died from a cause is a good way to show that cause exists. Humans care about each other. My opponent then delves into whether not a scientific consensus occurred. I find this part of the argument confusing and difficult to follow. The fact that my opponent used pastebin only further complicates the matter. My opponent claims that the true consensus number is .3% as opposed to 97.1%. I doubt science magazine missed up by such a large error or any of the other scholarly peer reviewed articles. \"Yes, because of the regulations being put on the fossil fuel industry by the government in an attempt to stop something that is naturally occurring. So this isn't a fault of the industry- it's the government that's implementing the regulations that would drive the industry to the ground. Like the article itself said,\" Repcon I can understand the fossil fuel industries objections, but the fossil fuel industry appears to spreading misinformation. Most likely you are in denial about man-made global climate change is due to this misinformation campaign. \"Again, this has NOTHING to do with what is supposed to be discussed. It doesn't prove that global warming is man made, so it shouldn't have been brought up in the first place.\" Repcon I've already proven global climate change exists, I'm only showing why there are still deniers. \"First off, it is unknown if the Koch Brothers' donations led to any biases in research. As for the scientist who is claimed to be biased, his research is supported by data looking at the sun activity and temperature over the last 100 years [6], like I presented in my Round 2 argument. And if you're bringing up funding biases, you might as well bring up the fact that the government participates in the same thing.\" Repcon Yes, but independent studies have also verified government research. \"An independent study of global temperature records has reaffirmed previous conclusions by climate scientists that global warming is real.\" [19] \"Our energy policy is not rigged to help the oil industries. If anything, it's rigged AGAINST the fossil fuel industry. We have regulations that, as stated before, will destroy the fossil fuel industry,\" Repcon The oil industry seems to be just fine. Just the fact that they could lose 33 trililon dollars shows their wealth and influence. \"First off, there are no crimes committed, and you haven't provided a source to back it up. Second off, jailing climate deniers is unconstitutional. One reason is known as the first amendment, which grants freedom of speech [8]. Another reason is that the U.S. isn't a facist government, and pretty much goes against facism, so good luck trying to get deniers arrested. Nice try, though.\" Repcon The climate change deniers are selling false information. They are committing fraud just for starters. \"Fraud must be proved by showing that the defendant's actions involved five separate elements: (1) a false statement of a material fact,(2) knowledge on the part of the defendant that the statement is untrue, (3) intent on the part of the defendant to deceive the alleged victim, (4) justifiable reliance by the alleged victim on the statement, and (5) injury to the alleged victim as a result.\" [20] Number five, injury to the alleged victim as a result, many people die annually from anthropogenic climate change. This is fraud that results in the death of the victim. This is immoral. The first amendment does not protect criminals from commiting fraud. If anyone is the fascist here it is the fossil fuel industry. The poor get hit the hardest, minorities tend to be poorer. This could be seen as the mass murder of minorities on the fossil fuel industries part.

            "text": "So, I'm going to go down my arguments since my opponent just answered my points without creating any of his own. Framework Extend both points as they were untouched and therefore conceded within the round. 1. He makes to generic arguments under this general point. The first is that human is distinct from organs, But I would argue this isn't true. Human shall be defined as anything genetically homo sapien. This definition is preferable for two reasons. Firstly, It utilizes the first part of my framework that we should focus on tangible benefits like research opportunities, Meaning we need to use strictly scientific definitions. Secondly, Self preservation doesn't justify an infant as human, Nor the disabled, So I would say my opponent's definition is going down a dark hole of ableism that needs to be avoided. The second point he makes is that the benefit to scientific research is non-unique, But that doesn't make it wrong. Unless he can prove that an unlimited supply of organs and cadavers of all genetic possibilities is not going to benefit scientific research, The point stands. A. Simply saying Nazis thought the same thing doesn't prove anything. Nazis also supported wearing clothes, Without a more justified position, This is a meaningless statement. Also, If he tries to go for a morality argument here, Don't by it. He ceded that tangible benefits are more important than moral ones in the framework, So any moral argument will always be evaluated second to tangible ones. Also, I don't have to prove it will result in the evolution of the human race, Just that it could, And with the ability to create endless clones/organs to work with and genetically modify, It definitely ups the possibility to a near 100% chance. B. I said an army of cadavers, Not a clone army. Imagine if your insurance agency paid to have a brainless clone of you grown every 10 years so you could have a constant replacement of organs. Also, Any moral arguments here about the valorization of life is irrelevant since my opponent agreed to the framework. 2. Cloning would logically allow us to multiply faster, And multiplying faster would logically allow us to colonize the galaxy faster. Unless you can prove it doesn't, I would say points logically follow through. Simply saying \"you don't have evidence\" doesn't negate the point I made, Especially since you have no evidence in your speech either. A. Firstly, Claiming slippery slope doesn't mean the conclusion is wrong. Secondly, That's how the economy works. If the population starts growing, As well as the amount of markets there are from off-world economies, Then the economy will grow. It's up to you to prove it won't at this point. B. To clarify this argument, I'm simply saying that a larger population allows us to have more troops if necessary to fight aliens in a galactic war. Since he didn't actually attack it, It stands as a point. 3. Cloning has multiple forms. I get to defend all forms of cloning, Organ and people. Since he never attacked this point, It still stands."

If your 'product' is simply the flow of information, the only feasible business model is to be pretty much the only player in a given market. Humans must recognize that data giants are creatures fundamentally different from, and superior to, brick and mortar corporations of the previous century, and even sovereign states. New rules must be established for them.\n\nData is the new oil: whoever controls the flow of information can or will eventually control everything. The problem is not that Twitter deplatformed Trump. A democratic process to establish rules for when someone can be 'censored' would have likely ended in the same result. The problem is that those rules were not made democratically and are not enforced in a transparent and accountable process. Instead the rules are made and enforced by a few data oligarchs with zero accountability to the people who create all the value they feed off, and who are most prominently affected by their decisions. \n\nMore and more 'real' jobs will become obsolete and be performed instead by AI, which will probably be owned by tech giants. This directly removes economic power from humans, and concentrates it in the hands of the few major shareholders and directors of these companies (Amazon's destruction of the entire retail value chain in the US is a good example). This immense value should instead flow to the human participants of these systems, as some form of data dividend or UBI, to offset the loss of income caused by automation. \n\nNo given nation state can or should constrain tech giants. The machinery of traditional democracy is too slow and inefficient. Additionally, the impacts that these companies have are transnational by their very nature. The democracy that should control them has not yet been born but, I believe, will be based online, rather than geographically determined jurisdictions.\n\nI don't believe that the options available in terms of antitrust regulation can effectively deal with data monopolies. Antitrust law is based on a number of presumptions that simply don't apply to giant tech (such as the presumption that monopoly will always lead to a failure in quality and a rise in prices). Breaking them up will take us a few steps back in terms of information flow, but will not change the fact that monopoly is completely logical and even necessary for a data-driven platform to function properly. Whatsapp only works because pretty much everyone uses it. It should be owned by everyone.\n\nHumans generate the data that enrich these companies and give them overwhelming power to shape and exploit our perceptions and our very lives and futures. Thus, humans should also control them and benefit from the value they 'create'."

What would be so bad about that? A tyrannical government doesn't care about you or your family. To trust any government fully is very dangerous. You: \"But imagine that there is not a single gun in the USA for a moment.\" My response: There are more guns than people in America. I can appreciate your imaginative thinking, but this is a Utopian world. In fact, it's not a Utopia, because millions of Americans enjoy hunting and shooting sports. (These are law-abiding citizens, by the way.) My point on this is that the idea of \"not a single gun in the USA\" is not going to happen; it's just not. There will always be guns in America. This is where we now have to make a decision about what sounds more reasonable: 1. Would you rather have guns be legal in the US where good guys and bad guys will have them, regardless? (Goods guys with guns who can stop bad guys with guns) OR 2. Would you rather have guns outlawed and only criminals can get them? (Criminals don't care about the law, and they will get guns even if they are banned... Murder is illegal but criminals do it anyway.) You: \"Again, there are no guns in this world, and so they'd use other weapons, such as fire, swords, etc. And if the rebels are the majority of the population, then the government would be outnumbered.\" My response: Again, you are referring to an imaginary world where there are no guns. This world is imaginary for a reason; it's impossible. More importantly, the last sentence frankly sounds like Star Wars. The only difference is that in Star Wars, the good guys almost always win, and Star Wars doesn't have Nazis. Just 6 million Nazis killed 20 million people. Majority doesn't equal victory. Also, in government tyranny, the corrupt government confiscates all the citizens' guns; citizens are left unarmed but the tyrannical government is not. Why would a tyrannical government disarm themselves? They wouldn't. Therefore, the government would win because a bunch of bad guys with guns can, will, and have demolished populations of unarmed innocents with EASE. You: \"My point is that there are other weapons you can use in order to overthrow a corrupt government. \" My response: Like what? Name one that would be effective against a tyrannical government. Swords, fire, rocks, bow and arrows, etc. wouldn't have defeated the Nazis, the Soviets or any other evil tyrants. You: \"If there were no guns, then there would be no mass murdering anymore because there would be no weapon (except a bomb) that could kill masses amount of people. I mean, it's pretty difficult to kill a great number of people with just a knife, right?\" My response: This is where your argument falls apart. The simple fact is, guns certainly aren't just going to disappear off the face of the Earth. Even if you ban guns in every city, country and continent in the world (which will never happen), criminals will still find a way to obtain them and kill enormous amounts of (unarmed) innocent people. Next, a knife isn't the only thing other than guns that can be used to kill people: In 2016, 10,497 Americans were killed by drunk drivers. Should we ban alcohol outright? Should we ban cars? The lifetime odds of being killed in the US from any murderer with a gun are 1 in 315. 1 in 108 deaths are due to all motor vehicle incidents. 1 in every 122 Americans are killed annually from... falling. Should we ban stairs? These are compared to ALL gun-related incidents. However, you were talking specifically about mass shootings. While these are unexplainable acts of evil and terror, the odds of being killed in a mass shooting in the US are 1 in 11,125. 1 in 1,133 are killed by drowning. Should we ban pools and visiting lakes, rivers, etc.? 1 in every 2,499 are killed in airplanes, boats and spaceships. Should we ban those? The people riding them? 1 in 2,517 are killed by assault from any sharp object. Should we ban knives? Everyday cooking ware? 1 in every 4,030 Americans will be killed in bicycling incidents. Should we ban bicycles, and every other form of transportation vehicle, for that matter? All of these previously mentioned items could become a weapon, if abused by a psychopath. The point is, when trying to outlaw anything, there will be repercussions. One last point: 2.5 million law-abiding citizens use firearms to save lives every year. 30,000 citizens are killed in firearm-related incidents annually (2/3 of which are suicides). Guns are used to save lives 227 times more than they are used in homicides. Lastly, I appreciate your willingness to have a real debate. Far too many are so closed-minded and quick to make gross accusations, but you are clearly open to a real conversation."

So the union will not have much of a problem in the long term. In any case Hindu-nationalist parties like the BJP will ultimately lose their power in the proposed union since minority religions like Islam will become larger, which is obviously not good for the BJP, and similar religious parties. My opponent might say that the BJP will prevent such a union from taking place, but I would like to remind him/her that in this debate it is assumed that the union takes place. My opponent stated this - \"Besides, corruption itself is one of the reasons why the union won't fall through.\" Again, it is assumed that the union takes place. Terrorists in India: My opponent mentioned that India isn't \"decisive enough to take a stand against the extremists who plague THEIR OWN LAND\" In the past there have been rebellions and insurgents too, like Khalistan rebels in Punjab. They were dealt with by the Indian army. Even the Maoist insurgency that my opponent mentioned has been on sharp decline since 2010. http://en.wikipedia.org... So this proves that India is capable of dealing with insurgencies and terrorism, the islamists are no different. So the proposed Union will be able to deal with the Islamists, the same way India dealt with these insurgents. My opponent has requested that I state new arguments for this round, I shall gladly do so. I will be focusing on Pakistan. Pakistan and internal violence: Pakistan has always considered India as its number one enemy. This presence of hostilities has always been the reason for Pakistan to be spending money for making larger armed forces, rather than spending it on development. Terrorists/Insurgents like Al Qaeda and the Baluchistani Insurgents wreck havoc on the country while the government is too concerned with politics with India. Pakistan's own allies, the US is drone striking Pakistani territories and killing civilians. The US became allied with Pakistan because India had close ties with USSR in the cold war era (and still continues close ties with Russia), if the US was not allied with Pakistan, the Pakistani government would never have allowed such drone strikes, thus the historical tension with India indirectly led to the US drone strikes. In the proposed Union, the Insurgents will be defeated as tensions cease to exist between India and Pakistan and the focus of the governments can be on the Insurgents. Also the US will not be allowed to use their drones since it is more likely that the union will have the political viewpoints of India (since it is larger and at the center) and not Pakistan. The US may stop themselves as they do not want to anger a much larger country. http://www.dnaindia.com... http://en.wikipedia.org... The Threat of Nuclear War: This is perhaps the biggest concern in the region. India and Pakistan, which together hold more than 14% or 1/7 of the worlds population, are nuclear armed. The two countries are engaging in an arms race (similar to the cold war but a smaller scale) http://tribune.com.pk... If the two countries EVER exchange nuclear weapons it could be catastrophic to the world, due to nuclear winter/famine and of course the radiation. http://www.telegraph.co.uk... The two countries have come very close to having a nuclear war http://en.wikipedia.org... http://news.bbc.co.uk... As stated in the article, the Pakistani PM refused to renounce the first use of nuclear weapons Neither Pakistan nor India has signed the non proliferation treaty, so they don't plan to abandon Nuclear weapons anytime soon. In the proposed Union there will be no such threats since the tensions between India and Pakistan don't exist since they are one and the same in the Union. A summary of my points: - Though there is religious violence now, casualties are far fewer than before, and they will continue to fall in the proposed Union since very religious parties like the BJP will lose power. Even if current level of religious violence continues in the union, it is not a high rate for a country of almost 1.5 BILLION people. - India has proven itself to deal with insurgencies and continues to do so against the Naxalites. The same will be done to the Islamists in the proposed Union. Pakistan is not capable of doing the same as it is too distracted with politics with India. - War, especially nuclear war can have a huge impact on the region and even the world, India and Pakistan are likely to keep bickering and even possibly exchanging nukes. A Union would put an end to all the international disputes between India and Pakistan."

            "text": "However, Pro has also made some insensitive assertions, and his stand continues to be quite unrealistic. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Rebuttals _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Compared to the thousand or more that died in the past riots that con has mentioned, the Muzaffarnagar violence resulted in only 63 deaths How can Pro say such a thing? I know he said that they do matter, but in my opinion it is still extremely insensitive to say that just because the number of casualties is reducing, communal violence is reducing. More than FIFTY THOUSAND people were rendered homeless. What does Pro have to say about them? It is extremely saddening that Pro thinks communal riots are about death tolls alone. Communal violence should not only be spoken in terms of how many people died. The death toll only serves to show the loss of life, and not of property. The violence is either there, or not there. Right now, IT'S STILL THERE. The death toll can rise or fall depending on many factors, and NOT just people's sentiments as my opponent thinks. Besides the death toll, there's also the figures of the number of people injured, those displaced, those arrested and those convicted. Unless my opponent takes these into account, I simply cannot take his thoughts on communal riots seriously. --------------------------------------- My opponent might say that the BJP will prevent such a union... but I would like to remind him/her that in this debate it is assumed that the union takes place. My opponent stated this - \"Besides, corruption... the union won't fall through.\" Again, it is assumed that the union takes place. And it is a VERY SHAKY assumption, Mr. Pro. At the moment, it only looks like the union will fall through BECAUSE OF AN IMPULSIVE REACTION from the people and the government. The situation is quite similar to the appointment of Pratibha Patil as the president of India. Everybody wanted a woman on the throne, and so they reacted on the impulse. Soon enough, everyone regretted it. http://zeenews.india.com... Therefore, based on current arguments, I believe everyone will end up regretting Pro's union, and it won't last long. Reasons: - Sooner or later, when corruption reduces(provided we take Pro's word for it), the \"netas\" will realize their positions are in trouble, and propose to annul the union. - Sooner or later, the Hindu-Muslim tension will boil over, and we'll have mayhem. - Sooner or later, the Tamils and the Sinhalese will get fed up of living in the same country, and the LTTE will return with the next Prabhakaran. -------------------------------------- So this proves that India is capable of dealing with insurgencies and terrorism, the islamists are no different. So the proposed Union will be able to deal with the Islamists, the same way India dealt with these insurgents. If it is the same way India dealt with the insurgents, then I weep for the future of the union. For some reason, Pro thinks that India's efforts to quell insurgency are effective. If India's methods really were that effective, the Maoists would never have reared their head above the ground. The Naxalites have been plaguing India for 46 YEARS (since 1967), and the government brought out their integrated action plan NO SOONER THAN 2009. http://www.globalresearch.ca... If THIS is what Pro calls effective, then very well. I'll believe that the union can deal with the Islamist faction. But I'm sure that it will be ANYTHING BUT IMMEDIATE. --------------------------------------- Terrorists/Insurgents like Al Qaeda and the Baluchistani Insurgents wreck havoc on the country while the government is too concerned with politics with India. I would like to remind Pro that Pakistan and India used to be one and the same. It is very obvious that the government would've thought of political tension with India before they demanded the partition. If they were so concerned about the tension with India, why did they still push for the partition? The answer is simple: THE PAKISTANIS WOULD RATHER SUFFER FROM VIOLENCE AND POLITICAL TURMOIL THAN UNITE WITH THE INDIANS. ---------------------------------------- The US may stop themselves as they do not want to anger a much larger country. The expanse of a country never stopped the US from angering the USSR. That's all I have to say. ---------------------------------------- In the proposed Union there will be no such (nuclear) threats since the tensions between India and Pakistan don't exist since they are one and the same in the Union. Once again, I would like to remind Pro of the pre-1947 scene. Even then, India and Pakistan were one and the same in a union. That didn't deter the Muslim League in the slightest. Can't history repeat itself? _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Con's remarks _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Though there is religious violence now, casualties are far fewer than before... An extremely blunt and insensitive statement. It is appalling that Pro didn't take loss of property into account. Is the death of people the only standard against which my opponent measures violence? Even if current level of religious violence continues in the union, it is not a high rate for a country of almost 1.5 BILLION people. Another insensitive remark by Pro. Religious violence is bad, whether it is in a country of 1.5 billion people, or 1.5 million people. It is either there, or not there. It will still persist in the union, and that is bad enough. ---------------------------------------- India has proven itself to deal with insurgencies and continues to do so against the Naxalites. India has proven itself to deal TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE with insurgencies. HOW DOES PRO JUSTIFY THE TENS OF THOUSANDS KILLED IN THE 40 YEARS THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT TOOK TO COME UP WITH A VIABLE COURSE OF ACTION? ---------------------------------------- A Union would put an end to all the international disputes between India and Pakistan. Most definitely not, as I showed earlier. A UNION WOULD TURN THE INTERNATIONAL DISPUTES INTO INTER-STATE DISPUTES, nothing more. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ My opponent has failed to even convincingly show how Pakistan and India can co-exist pecafully. PRO HASN'T EVEN GOTTEN TO THE SUBJECT OF SRI LANKA AND BANGLADESH'S CO-OPERATION. I await my opponent's closing statements in the final round."

            "text": "Challenge accepted. I shall be taking the side of Con for this debate. Pro's resolution is that ALL FIVE countries, namely India, Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, must be united into one nation. Hence, in order to win, I have to prove that the union of the countries shall be detrimental in an overall sense, and hence the countries should remain separate. I shall now proceed to refute my opponent's arguments. (Note: text in underlined italics refers to direct quote(s) from Pro) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Rebuttals ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ there are Muslims in India who live as peacefully as Hindus or any other religion... The above statement is NOT accurate. India has a bloody history of violence against, or instigated by, Muslims. Examples: - 1983 Nellie massacre A six-hour massacre that took place in Assam. Estimates of the death toll are as high as 5000. The reason: growing resentment against largely muslim immigrants from Bangladesh. http://www.hindu.com... http://en.wikipedia.org... - 1992-93 Bombay riots Hindu-Muslim riots, that were followed by the 1993 Bombay blasts. These riots occurred due to the demolition of the Babri Mosque by Hindu nationalists. Official death toll is around 900. http://kractivist.wordpress.com... http://en.wikipedia.org...; - 2002 Gujarat riots A passenger train was set on fire by a crowd of Muslims. What followed was another Hindu-Muslim conflict. Death toll estimates are over 1000. http://en.wikipedia.org...; -------------------------------------- ...so why is there a separate Muslim country? For good reason. If these riots and massacres in the past are an indication of anything, it is that there is still hate brewing between the loyalist Hindu and Muslim factions, and that the existence of Muslims in India is definitely not peaceful. The Muslim League demanded independence from India because they felt that Muslims can never live freely in a nation that literally calls itself \"Hindustan\", which means land of the Hindus. --------------------------------------- ...India has many cultures yet they all live side by side with no problem. Once again, my opponent is wrong. To state that there is \"no problem\" between the people of many cultures in India is highly ignorant. Hindu-Muslim conflicts in India need no introduction. Apart from this, there have been conflicts between Muslims & Christians, Hindus & Christians, Muslims & Sikhs, Hindus & Sikhs, and even Muslims & Buddhists. http://www.e-ir.info... http://www.culturalsurvival.org... http://en.wikipedia.org... Cultural boycotts are still commonplace in many states in India. Though India puts up a front of being the most secular nation in the world, there is sizeable tension between cultural and ethnic groups. --------------------------------------- India, the closest thing in the present day to a united south Asia, is doing well. I'm afraid Pro does not know India's current economic and political situation well enough. The country's current government is little more than a sham, being mired in multiple corruption scams. The resentment among people has gone so far that common men are forming political parties to seize control of the nation. At present, India is NOT doing well. http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com... ...(India) has the world's third largest and disputably one of the strongest army in the world It is true that India has a large army. But numbers don't mean strength. In all their wars, India has never once managed to win convincingly against Pakistan, whose numbers have always been far inferior to their own. The Indian army does have capable generals and brave soldiers. But the ugly truth is that it isn't getting enough support from the government. http://www.csmonitor.com...(page)/2 --------------------------------------- If all the countries unite then certainly all of the problems listed above will be minimized. I find this statement false. My reasons are as follows: - India, which clearly seems to be the leader in Pro's proposed union, has more than enough problems of its own. - Pakistan, by uniting with India, brings the danger of many parts India themselves being a target of terrorist attacks. There is no guarantee of the attacks on Pakistan reducing, but the probability of India being attacked more often definitely increases. - Accommodating the economically weaker countries of Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan is only going to put a larger strain on India's own economy, which, at present, is anything but stable. - Many (although not all) Muslims in Pakistan and Bangladesh are well known to harbour hatred and ill-will against the Hindu population of India. The feeling is mutual among the Hindus as well. A union raises the possibility of communal violence. - Sri Lanka hates the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, and Tamil Nadu hates Sri Lanka. I know that Pro assumed all countries agreeing to the union, but it seems HIGHLY UNLIKELY at this point. ...fear of terrorism would be lower and the economy will be better The fear of terrorism will definitely not be lower, as I stated earlier. As goes for the economy, it will only be better for the weaker nations, whereas India will suffer. Overall, the situation remains the same. The average standard of living will remain unchanged. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ What Pro is trying to propose can be compared to dumping sewage in a river. The sewage does become cleaner than, but the river gets polluted as well. It is nothing more than a process of dilution, which my opponent does not seem to have noticed. I eagerly await Pro's response in round 2."

            "text": "To answer Pro's question in round one, we are talking about the state system. Argument 1: Costs The death penalty often makes cases much more costly than similar non-death penalty cases. For example, a 2003 legislative audit in Kansas found that the costs for a single death penalty case was 70 percent more than a comparable non-death penalty case in the state; for general statistics, death penalty case costs (median costs $1.26 million) were counted through to execution, while non-death penalty costs were counted to the end of incarceration (median costs $740,000) [1]. At trial level cases in Washington state, death penalty cases generate roughly $470,000 in additional costs to the prosecution and defense over the cost of trying the same case as an aggravated murder without the death penalty, which costs at most $70,000 for court personnel [2]. Enforcing the death penalty costs Florida $51 million a year above what it would cost to punish all first-degree murderers with life in prison without parole; based on the 44 executions Florida had carried out since 1976, that amounts to a cost of $24 million for each execution; in Texas, a death penalty case costs an average of $2.3 million, about three times the cost of imprisoning someone in a single cell at the highest security level for 40 years; the most comprehensive study in the country found that the death penalty costs North Carolina $2.16 million per execution over the costs of sentencing murderers to life imprisonment [3]. I could continue quoting statistics, but I think my basic point has been made; more examples can be found at sources [3] and [4]. The death penalty should not be considered cost effective. Argument 2: Deterrence of crime The death penalty can be a terrifying punishment, and it would be rational to think it acts as a deterrence to certain criminal activity; this is generally not the case, and one can deduce this through rational thinking and a look into statistics. People with mental illnesses, people absolutely enraged, people panicking, and people under the influence of drugs, such as alcohol, are not likely to take the death penalty in mind when committing a crime that may warrant the death penalty. Almost one in four victims of violent crime report that the perpetrator had been drinking before committing the violent crime [5]. Between 31 percent and 36 percent of prisoners convicted of a violent crime against an intimate reported that they were drinking alcohol at the time of the offense; these figures rise to approximately 50 percent when reports from those who were consuming both alcohol and drugs at the time of the offense are considered [5]. Furthermore, research has shown nearly all death row inmates suffer from brain damage because of trauma or illness, while 5 to 10 percent of death row inmates suffer from serious mental illness [6]. The death penalty, if meant to deter certain extreme crimes, has a very difficult time doing so, since those who commit these extreme crimes are not likely to consider the death penalty when committing their crimes. Furthermore, murder rates in non-death penalty states are consistently lower than the murder rates in death penalty states, suggesting that the death penalty fails to deter murder [7]. This even applies to specific cases where a death penalty state and a non-death penalty state border each other. For example, Iowa, a non-death penalty state that borders Missouri, a death penalty state, has a lower murder rate than Missouri [8]. The source, link below, provides further examples. This means that the trend that death penalty states have a higher murder rate than non-death penalty states remains consistent, regardless of the general location of the states. Now, this does not mean that the death penalty does not deter any crimes. That said, I have already presented statistics of the costs because of the death penalty. My opponent would have to show that the death penalty deters enough crime to justify the amount of money spent on death penalty cases and trials each year, when this money could be used for other crime control measures that could be more effective. If he fails to do so, then the death penalty should not be considered an effective way for the states to use when trying to control or reduce crime. Argument 3: Innocence Out of the over 1,000 people executed since 1976, it is difficult to determine who was truly innocent. That said, humans are fallible; thus, it is possible for human beings to make a mistake in trials involving the death penalty, which means innocent people could be executed. Most courts generally do not entertain the possibility that they executed an innocent person, while defense attorneys focus their attention on clients' who can be saved. If a person is sentenced to a lifetime of prison, and if new evidence for their innocence is revealed while serving their time, then they could be released. With the death penalty, the innocent person cannot be brought back to life; similarly, people cannot be given back their time that was lost serving their sentence, but being dead is much worse. Since the rounds are not particularly structured and Pro shall have an opportunity each round to respond to my arguments, I retain the right to introduce new arguments later on in the debate. For the time being, however, I shall let Pro state his arguments in favor of the death penalty while responding to mine. Nonetheless, I have argued that the death penalty is not cost effective while also arguing that it is not an effective deterrent of crime. Furthermore, I have argued that the possibility of innocents dying in an imperfect system should make the death penalty unacceptable. My job was to argue against the legalization of the death penalty, and I have done so. [1] http://www.amnestyusa.org... [2] http://deathpenalty.procon.org... [3] http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org...

It makes you a killer but with public opinion on your side and a notion of justice which isn't the case. Why is it that America holds a sanctity for life, and yet kill people for killing people how does that make sense its hypocritical. Case: 1. The death penalty can and has killed innocent people, the government has killed innocents making it murder. Under the death penalty rules technically all the people in the cases with innocent people killed should themselves be put on trial and killed. However it doesn't work that way, the accused is the only one getting blamed for a crime and if innocent but proven guilty will get the death penalty but then proven innocent after the sentence has already been carried out the government just goes oops sorry. 2. Death penalty cost more than life in prison without parole. Evidence : Dudley Sharp, Death Penalty Resources Director of Justice For All (JFA), in an Oct. 1, 1997 Justice for All presentation titled \"Death Penalty and Sentencing Information,\" wrote: \"Many opponents present, as fact, that the cost of the death penalty is so expensive (at least $2 million per case?), that we must choose life without parole ('LWOP') at a cost of $1 million for 50 years. Predictably, these pronouncements may be entirely false. JFA estimates that LWOP cases will cost $1.2 million - $3.6 million more than equivalent death penalty cases. There is no question that the up front costs of the death penalty are significantly higher than for equivalent LWOP cases. There also appears to be no question that, over time, equivalent LWOP cases are much more expensive... than death penalty cases. Opponents ludicrously claim that the death penalty costs, over time, 3-10 times more than LWOP.\" I await response..."

Star Wars paints a black and white picture of morality, whereas Star Trek often reveals shades of grey [8][9]. Having a TV record allows them to have a variety of stories. This is like the problem above, Star Wars is all about the Sith/Force/Jedi. It is one clear and common good v. evil trope [10]. Star Trek is about exploration, the TV format allows them to have a variety of enemies, problems, and characters. The TV format also allows for deeper character development. Effects wise, maybe Star Wars does beat early Star Trek when comparing it to older films. Although, those movies aren't suppose to have big space wars like Star Wars does. With Star Wars, there's doubt that the prequels were originally conceived. There seems to be a lot of mistakes in the retconning, which create plot holes [12].

Star Wars has three movies\"six, if you count the prequels. The total run time of all six movies is less than 14 hours. Though both franchises also boast a healthy extended universe in the form of novels, comics, and games, Star Trek handily beats Star Wars in screen time by more than 21 days. Let me rephrase that. Star Trek has over 37 times the material available for your viewing pleasure than Star Wars does. That is pretty much unbeatable. The Star Trek franchise has the wonderful ability to both summon tremendous nostalgia and still produce sexy new stuff. To compare with Star Wars, the original Star Trek series debuted in 1966, and A New Hope came eleven years later in 1977. The Revenge of the Sith came out in 2006 and has a respectable 80% on Rotten Tomatoes, but in 2009 Star Trek starring Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto was released, and that holds an impressive Rotten-Tomatoes 95%."

If we were to abolish the death penalty in ANY state, whether it be California (possibly) or Texas (Not a chance) the crime rate for crimes that would normally put you on death row would increase dramatically. $308 million is not that much in comparison to our current debt (sadly). You say improving prison conditions? We need to lower the comfortableness in jails, we don't need air conditioning and TV in a place meant for punishment [1]. Now of course we need to make sure nobody dies in jail, but it don't need to be extremely comfy. The fact that innocent people are convicted of felonies is sad, but abolishing the death penalty is not the answer, we need more investigations into crimes that involve death so that doesn't happen. We already use inmates as workers when they don't kill people, the pro argument says inmates on death row should work instead of die, the problem is that, like I said, will rise the crime rate. Because people are afraid of death, so they won't kill people knowing that they could die."

            "text": "I will jump straight to the debate. C1) A single death sentence is very expensive \"The study estimates that the average cost to Maryland taxpayers for reaching a single death sentence is $3 million - $1.9 million more than the cost of a non-death penalty case. (This includes investigation, trial, appeals, and incarceration costs.)\"[1] You really have to think about this one; three million per death sentence? That is a huge waste in tax dollars. Now, tax dollars may not seem like a big deal to you, but it is. This is something for everyone to take in mind, including kids; Everyone will grow up to a point where money will be a big concern. The huge waste in tax dollars can result in the raise of taxes. Of course the U.S. government wants to become a top-rating country. All countries' governments do, and if that is something you are against, maybe because of taxes, you can not do anything about it. So, they will raise taxes if they need to. Now, you may be asking, \"Why do they even need taxes in the first place?\" Taxes are what pay for street projects, building projects, etc. Basically, taxes pay to improve the U.S. And these improvements are what is going to get the U.S. going. C2) Inmates can be executed by mistake, and execution can not be reversed. \"Once an inmate is executed, nothing can be done to make amends if a mistake has been made\"[2] This is a pretty big one. This is stated my many, including me, that are in opposition to the concept of the death penalty. Inmates can be executed by mistake. In fact, very many innocent people that were not capable of proving it were sentenced to death[3]. C3) The detterent value of the death penalty has not yet been proven. Some of death penalty's advocates claim that it is a detterent to all crime. However, as recently stated by the General Assembly of the United Nations, \"there is no conclusive evidence of the deterrent value of the death penalty.\"[4] There not only is no conclusive evidence to its detterent value, but you would think that criminals know that their lives are over, thus they make the last of it by commiting more crimes while they can. The execution goes by in a snap. This contention is agreed upon by my opponent, so there is no need in responding to this one. Now, my opponent defines death penalty as the penalty of death given to those who have commited serious crimes, such as killing, but with no doubt of their guilt. We normally do not go by it as that; we typically think that people are sentenced to death even with a bit of doubt of their guilt. My opponent should know this, so it should have been defined in the first round. Someone who is against death penalty may agree with the concept IF it is only given when there is no doubt of the criminal's guilt. Therefore, in this debate, you must go by the typical definition, and if reinstated, you must define death penalty. Now, I will refute my opponent's argument. C1) It ensures that that person can not come back at us. My opponent knows that with the death penalty at hand, those criminals whom have commited serious crimes can not escape prison and get back at us. However, as I said, we must go by the typical definition of death penalty. So, thinking about the contentions I have presented against the death penalty, we must say that the cons outnumber the benefits. Also, prisoners do not escape often. The percentage of prisoners whom escape in a year ranges from 1% to less than 5%, which is ridiculous[5]. The further proves my point about the cons of death penalty outnumbering the pros. I now return the floor to con. I would like to see if he will be able to refute my arguments. Good luck to him! [1] http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org... [2] http://deathpenaltycurriculum.org...

            "text": "We affirm that resolved: Private sector investment in human space exploration is preferable to public sector investment. In this round, the Con has the burden of proving that human space exploration is worthwhile for the government to fund, and that this approach is superior to all other alternatives. To clarify, we would like to define two terms. First, according to Princeton University, investment is \"laying out money or capital in an enterprise with the expectation of profit.\" This means that when NASA contracts with private companies, it is considered a purchase, not an investment. Second, Merriam Webster Dictionary defines exploration as \"the act of investigating, studying, or analyzing,\" so human space exploration is not limited to long trips into deep space. Contention 1: Human space exploration programs are not suitable for the government to fund. In decision making, the government must always be held to highest possible standards. When a private individual makes an investment, he or she risks losing their own money; however, when the government carelessly invests, any incurred loss essentially affects millions of citizens. With its limited funds, the government must ascertain that every expenditure is closely examined and completely justified, so as to satisfy the numerous needs of its diverse citizens. Today, no country in the world with an adequate space program can afford to allocate money to human Madison Memorial CS space exploration. According to the Space Review on January 11th, 2010, even the United States, an original pioneer in space exploration and the currently outstanding leader in relevant technologies, has acknowledged a decreased interest in pursuing long term projects in space. Despite its historic prestige, political support has shifted elsewhere\u2014to things like education, tax cuts, and environmental programs. The recent retirement of the Space Shuttle Program only further marks a shift in values to cutting spending. The rest of the world is in a similar state\u2014whether it is the EU, where members are constantly defaulting, or Russia, who relies on a fragile oil market\u2014deciding to spend their money in safer, smarter ways. Additionally, even if the government insisted on continued investment, robotic space exploration has proven to be much more efficient, lacking human problems of radiation, pressure, time, age and much more. Kluwer Academic Publishers even notes that the majority of the scientific community and NASA have started to see human spaceflight as \"an expensive \u2018stunt'.\" Considering the high standards of the government, it would seem reasonable to invest in the most effective method of furthering scientific knowledge. Contention 2: Private sector investment will produce better results. Currently, private corporations have shown to be far more effective at improving technology. For example, according to the Orlando Sentinel on Dec 28th, 2010, Madison Memorial CS Space X, a private company, tested its Dragon capsule\u2014an equivalent to NASA's nearly $10 billion expenditure on the Ares I rocket and Orion capsule, plagued with technical issues and worries\u2014for a miniscule $300 million, including design, manufacture, testing and launch. Even including costs for the Falcon 1and Falcon 9 rockets and building various launch sites, costs still total to less than $800 million. In addition, MIT's Technology Review on April 22nd, 2011 even stated that, due to the failure in public sector technology development, NASA would be paying Russians to take American astronauts into space, at a deal of $63 million per spacecraft seat, while SpaceX has the capability to do the same at a fraction of the cost. The driving force of competition, to encourage research and development will never appear in public sector investments. Private corporations have consistently proven to have quicker, better results and advance every individual aspect of their technologies. If the private sector had full responsibility for complete research, new developments for rockets would additionally translate to, for example, futuristic car engines. Furthermore, a full industry of scientific innovation and high paying jobs would grow, perhaps helping multiple states out of harsh economic times. Notably, the possibility of a high profit, upper atmospheric tourism industry is showing heavy promise with private investment. Contention 3: State space programs often stall and halt the progress of the Madison Memorial CS punctual and successful private industry. Timeliness has been a constant problem in space programs. Originally, NASA's Constellation program planned its first human space launch to the ISS in 2012; however, Norman Augustine on September 29th, 2010, notes that, because of ineffective allocation of funds and little external pressure, the task would not be completed for another nine years, until 2021. Contrastingly. NewSpace Journal on February 4th, 2011, indicates that five private companies, Blue Origin, Boeing, Paragon Space Development Corporation, Sierra Nevada Corporation and United Launch Alliance completed various tasks given by NASA in a very efficient and timely manner. Private sector corporations face constant pressure from both investors and competitors to improve already state of the art technology. Societies everywhere can, without fail, rely on private industries to perform and improve. For all the reasons stated above, my partner and I affirm the resolution."

Only, there is no breeze on the moon, meaning there is no air in the moon\"s atmosphere, and hence, there is no wind whatsoever. This is one of the most obvious stuff ups in the staged moon landing hoax. Of course, NASA tries to get around this by saying it wasn\"t blowing in the wind, it was just a bit crumpled from being rolled up on the journey\"Well, judge for yourself. NASA produced an abundant supply of photos and video footage to support their moon landing. But, it soon became evident that there was something a bit fishy about these photos on the moon; ever noticed that the angle of the shadows do not match up? Shadows are caused by light sources. On the moon, there should only be one light source: the Sun. So, logically, all shadows should be parallel to each other. Only shadows in the photos of moon landing are not. In fact, the shadows in many of the photos run in different directions. It\"s almost as if the shadows are caused by\" yes, multiple lights on a film set! On a cloudless evening, you can see an abundance of twinkling stars in the night sky. Surely from the moon, with its lack of clouds and complete absence of artificial light, you should be able to see even more stars with the naked eye? Only, you can\"t. In fact, in all of the photos taken during moon landing, you cannot see a single star. Not one. Sure, the photos taken in the 60\"s weren\"t amazing quality, but these days you can capture the stars in a photo taken from your phone, so shouldn\"t the high tech NASA cameras have been able to pick up something? NASA has marked out the exact locations of the moon landing missions, showing how they have explored sites that are miles apart. With that in mind, why do the photos from the Apollo 15 mission show identical backdrops? NASA swears that these photos were taken in different locations, yet the photographic evidence clearly shows the same patterns of gently sloping hills and valleys. It\"s almost like NASA were just getting sloppy by the time they hit the Apollo 15 mission. \"Why bother creating new sets, we\"ll just use the same ones repeatedly\"Surely no one will notice.\" In yet another example of the technicians on set just being sloppy, one of the moon landing photos shows a \"moon rock\" which has a perfect letter \"C\" printed on it. The perfect symmetry of the letter shows that it is not naturally occurring. Now, it\"s perfectly credible that a prop used on a film set would be marked with a reference letter. But there is no plausible argument for the \"C\" just being naturally weathered into the surface of the rock. As a result, NASA came up with a different, though no less implausible, explanation for the rock with the \"C\". According to them, it\"s a stray hair. It can\"t be more ridiculous than this! Everyone knows how dangerous radiation can be: overexposure to it can cause radiation poisoning and even death, so It is should be avoided at all costs. To get to the moon, you have to fly through a band a radiation known as the Van Allen radiation belt. Yes, the space craft had an aluminum coating, but is that really enough to protect a human being whilst they spend over one and a half hours traversing a band of radiation? NASA, of course, said \"yes\" and that the astronauts weren\"t in the radiation for all that long. But an hour and a half still sounds like a pretty long time to be inside a cosmic microwave. When the photos were published of the Apollo 12 moon landing, many people noticed something a tad unusual reflected in the shiny helmet of an astronaut. It appeared to be something hanging from a wire or perhaps a rope. In fact, it looked suspiciously like an overhead spotlight, the kind you see used in Hollywood movie studios. Whilst admittedly, the photo quality is a bit grainy, making it impossible to positively identify the object. It still begs the question: what could possibly be suspended in midair on the moon? There should be nothing there for anything to be hanging from! Have you ever seen the photos of the astronauts footprints embedded in moon dust? The astronauts described this dust as being similar to \"talcum powder or wet sand\". That being the case, why is there no sign of impact where the lunar module landed? You\"d think that a rocket-ship landing on a big pile of talcum powder would leave some kind of impression in the surface, but according to the moon landing photos, no such evidence exists. In fact, it looks more like the lunar module was just placed in position. This is just yet another blindingly obvious defect in the details of the moon landing hoax."

I will be claming that the USFG does need to increase investment in nuclear energy. Definitions: 1) Investment--a contribution of something such as time, energy, or effort to an activity, project, or undertaking, in the expectation of a benefit (source: MicrosoftWorks dictionary) 2) Nuclear power--the use of sustained nuclear fission to generate heat and do useful work, most of the time with the goal of producing commercially servicable electricity. Contentions: 1) Nuclear energy is a more environmentally friendly alternative to other, more conventional means of producing electricity. 2) Increased investment into nuclear energy would alleviate the United States' dependence on imported, environmentally unfriendly, petroleum-based energy sources. 3) Nuclear energy is a scientifically proven, known energy source that is \"ready for market\". Explanation of Contentions: 1) Nuclear energy is a more environmentally friendly alternative to other, more conventional means of producing electricity. Nuclear energy is among one of the world's cleanest energy sources. It produces very low levels of CO2 emissions and, during its lifetime, is comparable to so called \"green\" energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydro emissions [1]. The most up-to-date study, conducted at the Forsmark nuclear power facility in Sweden during 2005, shows that the plant was producing only 3.10 grams of CO2 per kilowatt per hour [1]. In contrast, information gathered from the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Agency shows that the average coal power plant in the United States during the year 2000 produced 2.095 pounds of CO2 per kilowatt per hour [2]. A simple mathematical calculation revels that nuclear power, on average, produces almost 97.8 percent less carbon dioxide emissions than coal power. Thus, nuclear power would be beneficial because it would lower carbon emissions consequently increasing air quality and curtailing this nation's contribution to global climate change. 2) Increased investment into nuclear energy would alleviate the United States' dependence on imported, environmentally unfriendly, petroleum-based energy sources. Currently, oil is the lifeblood of the American economy. Oil supplies 40 percent of the United States' total energy demands [3]. Today, nearly 60 percent of the oil utilized and consumed in the United States is imported from foreign countries [4]. Using middle school math, we can concur that 24 percent (nearly one-fourth) of our energy is supplied by oil drilled, refined, or otherwise produced in foreign countries. Noting the current geopolitical situation and the worldwide increase in oil demand, relying on foreign oil does not seem like a viable long-term economic strategy for the United States. Thus, the United States should be investing in other sources that can supply our nation with the energy its needs for continued global economic dominance. Nuclear power is the energy source that is best positioned to take that role as it has become one of the leading energy sources in the world. For example, nearly 75% of all energy consumed in France is produced by nuclear sources [5]. Not only has nuclear energy provided the French people with energy security, it has lead France to become a net energy exporter as it gains over 3 billion Euros (4,312,800,000 USD) from exporting nuclear power and nuclear power technology [5]. As it is clear to see in the precedent set by the French government, nuclear energy is a sustainable long-term energy source that can lessen a nation's dependence on unreliable, foreign-energy sources. 3) Nuclear energy is a scientifically proven, known energy source that is \"ready for market\". Unlike wind and solar energy, nuclear energy is a proven energy source that has been in use since 1942 [6]. Thus, the wide-scale adoption of nuclear energy in the United States would require very little additional research and development as most of the technologies to be used have already been formulated. Furthermore, the more widespread adoption of nuclear power in the United States would require no changes be made to the national power grid as it was constructed with nuclear energy in mind. In contrast, there are some questions about the practicality of wind, solar, and geothermal energy sources. I thank whoever shall accept this debate challenge in advance. Happy debating!

Opening statement: My opponent has produced some very impressive data on the efficiency of nuclear energy. Prima facie or first glance could easily sway a person to support nuclear energy. I vaguely recall having done rudimentary research on nuclear energy for a Lincoln-Douglas topic last fall. In fact, a conversation I had with our science department head revealed only one significant pitfall, what to do with the waste? My opponent has even identified dis-ads of nuclear waste and offered suggestions on the very subject of nuclear waste. If we dig deeper though, what are other concerns? Let's explore! 1) Effectiveness. At first glance the only disagreements I could identify were really nitpicky stuff. I could say that some of the water which became steam would inevitably evaporate and have to be replaced. I could even strengthen my opponent's defense by saying that the moving parts replacement schedule is likely very minimal. There is no shame in expanding Robert Fulton's use of steam even if it is an old idea. We still use wheels right? :o) There is no doubt that nuclear energy can offer power to communities. I, and the judges, are likely tired of semantical battles of topicality, that being said; much of my opponent's first point are stipulated and conceded. 2) Safety. This is a cause for concern. While technologically developed nations such as the U.S.A., the U.K., and France have operated plants for upwards of 60 years without serious incident, that does not make them immune to trouble. Many safeguards have been implemented since the 1950's to improve and upgrade the facilities. Yet, even superpowers such as the U.S. (3 mile island) and the former Soviet Union (Chernobyl) have had their share of growing pains. Most recently, another developed nation, Japan, experienced a calamity of catastrophic proportion. Are nuclear power plants compeletly safe? No. Now consider lesser developed nations that are seeking nuclear power, Iran and North Korea for example. Both are suspect for being politically unstable as well as using nuclear energy to develop nuclear weapons. Oversight can be a tricky thing when a more radical nation prefers not to be inspected or have other's watching over their shoulders as they attempt to develop energy, or secretly weaponry. This forces them to be sneaky, which may lead to shortcuts, which may lead to disaster. Security of nuclear facilities. There are high protocol, likely classified, to protect the integrity of nuclear facilities in developed nations. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for less stable nations. Can anyone, with any certainty, verify the count of every spent rod or piece of weaponry from the the Former Soviet Union, especially after the breakup of the former into 15 separate and independent nations? I would have to say no. Further, what would prevent well organized and well funded terrorists from acquiring nuclear materials in lesser developed nations? This too eats away at the safety argument. An article I discovered addresses nuclear waste in a different light than that of my opponent. Like my opponent, it identfied waste that was short term and had reduced effects with proper handling and recycling. Also, like my opponent it identified longer term waste. However; the safety of the longer term waste was the compelling factor. It is quite dangerous, ecologically unfriendly, and can take an estimated 1000 years to decay. http://www.scienceclarified.com... These are a few \"what if\" or otherwise hypothetical scenarios that challenge nuclear energy safety as well as historical examples such as 3 mile island, Chernobyl, and Japan. While precautions and protocol do exist, they are far from foolproof, and are not necessarily as safe as my opponent would have us believe. http://www.nirs.org... 3) Costs. My opponent has demonstrated that nuclear energy does indeed exceed the effectiveness of fossil fuels. It's common knowledge and widely accepted that once established, nuclear is more logical than fossil. It appears to be cleaner in emissions, and uses fewer resources in producing more energy. At first glance, this seems to make perfect sense. This leads me to ask a question. Why then isn't everyone using nuclear energy then? A Smithsonian study showed that only approximately 16% of the worl'd energy is nuclear based. Since it is demonstrably more effective as shown by my opponent's CBA, why aren't most nations using it? Simply put, the necessary precautions make it cost prohibitive. Many African and Central American nations struggle to even provide basic necessities to their citizens. Citizens in African nations do not enjoy clean water, adequate food, clothing, or shelter. Haiti and Honduras don't even have a pot to piss in. In fact, many nations have substandard living conditions to include plumbing and basic sanitation. Constructing a nuclear power plant is not in their foreseeable future. My case: At first glance my alternative seems to be a reinvention of the wheel. There are alternatives to nuclear energy though. All of which can be done at a fraction of the cost of nuclear energy, and boast a much better safety record. HYDRO: Every nation does have rivers. Dams can be constructed, and power can be retrieved via hydro energy. SOLAR: Especially with so many \"experts\" verifying the existence of greenhouse gases and global warming, you would think that would open the door even wider for good ol' solar power. Yes the sun shines all over the earth! Yes, solar panels are expensive, and yes, at present they need to be rather large to capture this energy. Why can't every roof be a solar panel? This is worth research and development money! Opportunity is knocking! (For my beloved Israelis, I am offering triple mitzvah points if you discover it first) Who among us on this earth will be the first to develop more efficient solar power for all to enjoy? WIND: The wind blows. Meterologists have ways to track weather and determine the most strategic locations to place wind energy generators. KINETIC GENERATORS: Quite possibly the world's best kept secret! These puppies are built at a nominal cost, and run virtually clean, quiet, and very efficient. This is probably the better answer to the energy crisis. We (Collectively) have put boo-koodles of investment money into so many things. It makes sense to look into research for the large scale, big picture. http://www.homestandbygeneratorsystems.com... In closing: While nuclear energy is a better alternative than fossil fuels, it has yet to replace them. Why? It is both dangerous, and cost prohibitive. I am suggesting that nuclear energy research monies be diverted toward large scale research of kinetic generators. Thank you!"

I will be claming that the USFG does need to increase investment in nuclear energy. Definitions: 1) Investment--a contribution of something such as time, energy, or effort to an activity, project, or undertaking, in the expectation of a benefit (source: MicrosoftWorks dictionary) 2) Nuclear power--the use of sustained nuclear fission to generate heat and do useful work, most of the time with the goal of producing commercially servicable electricity.

Burden of Proof - The BoP falls equally on both debaters to support and defend their arguments while refuting their opponent's. For example, Con can focus on negative effects to the environment, safety issues, or better alternatives rendering Nuclear obsolete, but Con cannot just disagree with everything Pro puts up (and vise versa). I will go ahead and present some definitions. Unless Con finds these definitions to be abusive, they are to be accepted. If Con finds them abusive, Con is free to present alternative definitions, but then it will be up to the voters to agree if my definitions are abusive or not. Nuclear energy (as it pertains to this debate) - The gathering of energy from nuclear fission or nuclear fusion to use in commercial purposes (such as electricity). Nuclear fission - A nuclear reaction in which a heavy nucleus splits spontaneously or on impact with another particle, with the release of energy. [1] Nuclear fusion - A nuclear reaction in which atomic nuclei of low atomic number fuse to form a heavier nucleus with the release of energy. [2] Con may present any additional definitions that they choose and may start debating in their R1, however, they are also free to pass it back to me to start in my R2. Additional definitions may be added as needed throughout the entire debate. [1] https://www.google.com...= [2] https://www.google.com...="

In fact, a conversation I had with our science department head revealed only one significant pitfall, what to do with the waste? My opponent has even identified dis-ads of nuclear waste and offered suggestions on the very subject of nuclear waste. If we dig deeper though, what are other concerns? Let's explore! 1) Effectiveness. At first glance the only disagreements I could identify were really nitpicky stuff. I could say that some of the water which became steam would inevitably evaporate and have to be replaced. I could even strengthen my opponent's defense by saying that the moving parts replacement schedule is likely very minimal. There is no shame in expanding Robert Fulton's use of steam even if it is an old idea. We still use wheels right? :o) There is no doubt that nuclear energy can offer power to communities. I, and the judges, are likely tired of semantical battles of topicality, that being said; much of my opponent's first point are stipulated and conceded. 2) Safety. This is a cause for concern. While technologically developed nations such as the U.S.A., the U.K., and France have operated plants for upwards of 60 years without serious incident, that does not make them immune to trouble. Many safeguards have been implemented since the 1950's to improve and upgrade the facilities. Yet, even superpowers such as the U.S. (3 mile island) and the former Soviet Union (Chernobyl) have had their share of growing pains. Most recently, another developed nation, Japan, experienced a calamity of catastrophic proportion. Are nuclear power plants compeletly safe? No. Now consider lesser developed nations that are seeking nuclear power, Iran and North Korea for example. Both are suspect for being politically unstable as well as using nuclear energy to develop nuclear weapons. Oversight can be a tricky thing when a more radical nation prefers not to be inspected or have other's watching over their shoulders as they attempt to develop energy, or secretly weaponry. This forces them to be sneaky, which may lead to shortcuts, which may lead to disaster. Security of nuclear facilities. There are high protocol, likely classified, to protect the integrity of nuclear facilities in developed nations. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for less stable nations. Can anyone, with any certainty, verify the count of every spent rod or piece of weaponry from the the Former Soviet Union, especially after the breakup of the former into 15 separate and independent nations? I would have to say no. Further, what would prevent well organized and well funded terrorists from acquiring nuclear materials in lesser developed nations? This too eats away at the safety argument. An article I discovered addresses nuclear waste in a different light than that of my opponent. Like my opponent, it identfied waste that was short term and had reduced effects with proper handling and recycling. Also, like my opponent it identified longer term waste. However; the safety of the longer term waste was the compelling factor. It is quite dangerous, ecologically unfriendly, and can take an estimated 1000 years to decay. http://www.scienceclarified.com... These are a few \"what if\" or otherwise hypothetical scenarios that challenge nuclear energy safety as well as historical examples such as 3 mile island, Chernobyl, and Japan. While precautions and protocol do exist, they are far from foolproof, and are not necessarily as safe as my opponent would have us believe. http://www.nirs.org... 3) Costs. My opponent has demonstrated that nuclear energy does indeed exceed the effectiveness of fossil fuels. It's common knowledge and widely accepted that once established, nuclear is more logical than fossil. It appears to be cleaner in emissions, and uses fewer resources in producing more energy. At first glance, this seems to make perfect sense. This leads me to ask a question. Why then isn't everyone using nuclear energy then? A Smithsonian study showed that only approximately 16% of the worl'd energy is nuclear based. Since it is demonstrably more effective as shown by my opponent's CBA, why aren't most nations using it? Simply put, the necessary precautions make it cost prohibitive. Many African and Central American nations struggle to even provide basic necessities to their citizens. Citizens in African nations do not enjoy clean water, adequate food, clothing, or shelter. Haiti and Honduras don't even have a pot to piss in. In fact, many nations have substandard living conditions to include plumbing and basic sanitation. Constructing a nuclear power plant is not in their foreseeable future. My case: At first glance my alternative seems to be a reinvention of the wheel. There are alternatives to nuclear energy though. All of which can be done at a fraction of the cost of nuclear energy, and boast a much better safety record. HYDRO: Every nation does have rivers. Dams can be constructed, and power can be retrieved via hydro energy. SOLAR: Especially with so many \"experts\" verifying the existence of greenhouse gases and global warming, you would think that would open the door even wider for good ol' solar power. Yes the sun shines all over the earth! Yes, solar panels are expensive, and yes, at present they need to be rather large to capture this energy. Why can't every roof be a solar panel? This is worth research and development money! Opportunity is knocking! (For my beloved Israelis, I am offering triple mitzvah points if you discover it first) Who among us on this earth will be the first to develop more efficient solar power for all to enjoy? WIND: The wind blows. Meterologists have ways to track weather and determine the most strategic locations to place wind energy generators. KINETIC GENERATORS: Quite possibly the world's best kept secret! These puppies are built at a nominal cost, and run virtually clean, quiet, and very efficient. This is probably the better answer to the energy crisis. We (Collectively) have put boo-koodles of investment money into so many things. It makes sense to look into research for the large scale, big picture. http://www.homestandbygeneratorsystems.com... In closing: While nuclear energy is a better alternative than fossil fuels, it has yet to replace them. Why? It is both dangerous, and cost prohibitive. I am suggesting that nuclear energy research monies be diverted toward large scale research of kinetic generators. Thank you!"

            "text": "Resolved: The United States federal government should increase investment in nuclear power sources. I am representing the affirmative position of the resolution. I will be claming that the USFG does need to increase investment in nuclear energy. Definitions: 1) Investment--a contribution of something such as time, energy, or effort to an activity, project, or undertaking, in the expectation of a benefit (source: MicrosoftWorks dictionary) 2) Nuclear power--the use of sustained nuclear fission to generate heat and do useful work, most of the time with the goal of producing commercially servicable electricity. Contentions: 1) Nuclear energy is a more environmentally friendly alternative to other, more conventional means of producing electricity. 2) Increased investment into nuclear energy would alleviate the United States' dependence on imported, environmentally unfriendly, petroleum-based energy sources. 3) Nuclear energy is a scientifically proven, known energy source that is \"ready for market\". Explanation of Contentions: 1) Nuclear energy is a more environmentally friendly alternative to other, more conventional means of producing electricity. Nuclear energy is among one of the world's cleanest energy sources. It produces very low levels of CO2 emissions and, during its lifetime, is comparable to so called \"green\" energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydro emissions [1]. The most up-to-date study, conducted at the Forsmark nuclear power facility in Sweden during 2005, shows that the plant was producing only 3.10 grams of CO2 per kilowatt per hour [1]. In contrast, information gathered from the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Agency shows that the average coal power plant in the United States during the year 2000 produced 2.095 pounds of CO2 per kilowatt per hour [2]. A simple mathematical calculation revels that nuclear power, on average, produces almost 97.8 percent less carbon dioxide emissions than coal power. Thus, nuclear power would be beneficial because it would lower carbon emissions consequently increasing air quality and curtailing this nation's contribution to global climate change. 2) Increased investment into nuclear energy would alleviate the United States' dependence on imported, environmentally unfriendly, petroleum-based energy sources. Currently, oil is the lifeblood of the American economy. Oil supplies 40 percent of the United States' total energy demands [3]. Today, nearly 60 percent of the oil utilized and consumed in the United States is imported from foreign countries [4]. Using middle school math, we can concur that 24 percent (nearly one-fourth) of our energy is supplied by oil drilled, refined, or otherwise produced in foreign countries. Noting the current geopolitical situation and the worldwide increase in oil demand, relying on foreign oil does not seem like a viable long-term economic strategy for the United States. Thus, the United States should be investing in other sources that can supply our nation with the energy its needs for continued global economic dominance. Nuclear power is the energy source that is best positioned to take that role as it has become one of the leading energy sources in the world. For example, nearly 75% of all energy consumed in France is produced by nuclear sources [5]. Not only has nuclear energy provided the French people with energy security, it has lead France to become a net energy exporter as it gains over 3 billion Euros (4,312,800,000 USD) from exporting nuclear power and nuclear power technology [5]. As it is clear to see in the precedent set by the French government, nuclear energy is a sustainable long-term energy source that can lessen a nation's dependence on unreliable, foreign-energy sources. 3) Nuclear energy is a scientifically proven, known energy source that is \"ready for market\". Unlike wind and solar energy, nuclear energy is a proven energy source that has been in use since 1942 [6]. Thus, the wide-scale adoption of nuclear energy in the United States would require very little additional research and development as most of the technologies to be used have already been formulated. Furthermore, the more widespread adoption of nuclear power in the United States would require no changes be made to the national power grid as it was constructed with nuclear energy in mind. In contrast, there are some questions about the practicality of wind, solar, and geothermal energy sources. I thank whoever shall accept this debate challenge in advance. Happy debating!

If you are the social freak (as every child in America is) then the iPhone would be a worth-while investment, because it has all of the social networking functions that connect you to the internet when you are away from your computer. But for mature adults, the Blackberry is the smarter option, because you have a keyboard instead of an on-screen keyboard, which can be tough to navigate with large adult hands. Plus, the Blackberry is a key factor in the work environment, because it links you directly to your work e-mail, documents, calendars, to-dos, alarms, etc. Overall, the Blackberry wins this battle to the iPhone, for it's maturity, diversity, and efficiency."

            "text": "I will be arguing that social media does NOT do more harm than good. Not necessarily to prove that it does more good however there are some interesting points that will help my case. First Social media has helped the growth of small businesses. Social media is used to drive targeted traffic, boost the site\u2019s SEO, and learn from its consumers through data collection (1). Here\u2019s a look at the social media often used for small business owners: Second These sites act as a social calendar that allow a person to visually see upcoming events for people hundreds of miles away. More birthdays are remembered, more grandmas are poked, and more social events begin to take place such as parties or game night. Third Many social media sites such as LinkedIn and Facebook have helped people get a job. In some cases, having a good online reputation can mean great opportunity. Being well adapted to the newest technology and ways of communicating can help advance their career as well as the people who decide to hire them. In fact, 9% of small businesses believe that a social media expert would be the most helpful for their business (3). Refuting spread of misinformation It does not increase the spread of misinformation (per person), actually quite the opposite. More information has been spread since the home computer was invented and the world wide web ensued. Propaganda has been used for over a century to tell lies and persuade the people, the difference today is that now people have the option to fact check (4). On Facebook for instance an individual has the choice of following a web page that has no scientific support or following someone who just rants and raves. Refuting that cyber bullying is a cause for social media to do more harm than good It\u2019s hard to refute that social media has caused the spread of cyber bullying, however this also has reduced the amount of physical bullying. The bullying isn\u2019t necessarily more common; it has just shifted to the computer. Many social media sites have taken extreme measures to reduce and hopefully eliminate cyber bullying (5). Social media doesn\u2019t want people to leave their website from cases of cyber bullying; it would result in a loss of profits. In other words, social media has helped reduce physical violence.

Social Isolation CON suggests that home schooled children may suffer from impaired socialization. This is a serious concern, which, thankfully, is not born out by the evidence. Home schooled children are not stuck in a classroom for 180 days a year, allowing more field trips, hands-on experience, and adult interaction [1]. I actually knew a family that home schooled, and between boy scouts, Taekwondo class, and other similar activities, there was plenty of socialization. Other Arguments CON has brought up numerous other concerns regarding home schooling, including lowered income, organizational challenges, parents needing time away, and parents needing a nap. I see no reason to address all of these issues individually. I agree that not everybody is capable of home schooling their children. A family will need to address the financial, organizational, and other challenges before they choose to take this route. The fact that these challenges exist does not in any way mean that home schooling is bad, or that it should not be done. It only shows that it is a serious undertaking that should not be undertaken by everybody. Wrapping Up I have demonstrated that home-schooling can be beneficial. CON has failed to provide evidence for any of his/her claims. I feel I have met the burden I accepted, while CON has failed in that respect. Source: [1] http://www.hslda.org..."

He also does not dispute the fact that the fans like Messi many times more than Ronaldo. My opponent, further, has not substantiated anything he has said. \"A key player is someone that can make things happen and score goals in free-kicks, penalties, headers, shots (both feet) and 1 vs 1. I have seen Ronaldo blast a shot and score with his weaker foot. Of course Messi can score with his weaker foot but most of them are close range finesse shots. Just lightly placing the shot in the goal is not as good a ripping a shot from 25-35 yards out with your weaker foot. Out of 10 free-kicks Messi will probably socre 2-3, but Ronaldo will score a good 7-8.\" The following has no citation, no justification, but simply is stating this as fact. Unfortunately, it is nto true. www.RONALDO7.net: Ronaldo vs Messi - Stats table I Season: 2011-2012 Cristiano Ronaldo Lionel Messi La Liga matches so far 23 23 Games played 23 23 Minutes played 2084 2076 Goals 28 27 Assists 7 8 Shots on Target 63 70 Passes 824 1267 As the table shows (sourced above) Messi, with less time on the ball, has had more shots on target, more assists, and 400 more passes than Ronaldo, at the cost of a single goal. Bearing in mind that Ronaldo had ten penalties that seasn (http://www.ronaldo7.net...), it is unreasonable to hope Messi scores more. In fact, it's testament to his skill. My opponent, in the end, resorts to simply attacking me by saying \" I am starting to feel like you are running out of things to talk about.\" The fact of the matter is, if a player cheats to win games, then he is automatically a terrible player. If Messi did steroids, then he would be one of the worst players imaginable. The best players are role models. What is Messi a role model for? He provides a figure of kindness, and a man who overcame adversity from illness and plays like a professional. Ronaldo plays like a spoilt kid who wants to win, no matter the cost. Who is the better player? Who is the better man? Lionel Messi. Motion denied."

Born Luis Lionel Andres Messi on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina. Messi, who stands just 5-foot 7-inches, got his start in the game at the age of 8, when he started playing for the Newell's Old Boys, a team in Rosario. Recognizably smaller than most of the boys he played with, Messi was eventually diagnosed by doctors as suffering from a hormone deficiency that restricted his growth. Medication wasn't cheap: about 500 a month, and Messi's parents couldn't afford to pay for it on their own. So, at the age of 13, when Messi was offered a chance to play for Barcelona with the opportunity to have his medical bills covered by the team, Messi's family picked up and moved across the Atlantic to make a new home in Spain. Short and fast with a fierce style of play, Messi soon drew comparisons to another famous Argentinean footballer: Diego Maradona. Messi moved quickly through the ranks of the team's junior system, and by the age of 16 Messi had made his first appearance for Barcelona. He put himself in the record books on May 1, 2005, as the youngest player to ever score a goal for the franchise. That same year he led Argentina to the title in the under-20 World Cup, scoring on a pair of penalty kicks to propel the team over Nigeria. In recent years Messi has become one of the game's highest paid players, earning an estimated $18 million a year. He's justified the price-tag by steering Barcelona to a wealth of success, most notably in 2009 when the left-footer's team captured the Champions League, La Liga, and Spanish Club titles. That same year, after two consecutive runner-up finishes, he took home the FIFA World Player of the Year award. Even the great Maradona has gushed about his fellow countryman. \"I see him as very similar to me,\" the retired player told the BBC. \"He's a leader and is offering lessons in beautiful football. He has something different to any other player in the world.\" Off the field Messi, who got his EU citizenship in 2009, has tried to make a name for himself. In early 2010, he was named a Goodwill Ambassador by UNICEF with a focus on fighting for children's rights across the globe.

My opponent's entire argument was copied and pasted from the same site."

This might also be a case of familiarity breeding something less than contempt -- when asked to choose who he'd rather play with, Pele said Ronaldo, because he considered Messi and himself to be too similar in terms of playing style."

People will think that abortion is the only way to go. I said that the very example of 2000 babies being born every day in the UK disproves that. Therefore, my opponent has made only 2 arguments, both of which have been conclusively rebutted, and therefore, as she made no mention of BoP, she is Pro, therefore I automatically win the debate because none of her arguments stand.

However there are a few problems with this argument: First, as indicated by my opponent\u2019s evidence we already subsidize Pakistan with around $20B, so in essence it has only cost them $50B. Second, Pakistan as indicated by my evidence is waging its own war on terror separate and non-advantageous for the United States. Remember, the U.S. is waging a war to dismantle the Afghani Taliban and the Haaqani Network \u2013 both of which the Pakistanis refuse to take action against. Third, my opponent needs to make an argument about why the amount of money Pakistan spends should determine if we ally with them. Otherwise there is no impact to this argument. Fourth, evidence TURN: my opponent\u2019s evidence on the Pakistani Budget is advocated by the opponent to President Zadari (Kahn) who wants Pakistan to end its war-relations with the U.S.. This turns my opponent\u2019s case because his authority is advocating de facto for the position that I am advocating. == My opponent argues that India has not helped in the War on Terror. However there are a few problems with this argument: First, the United States made a tactical choice in the region to ally with Pakistan over India. Clearly India who detests Pakistan would not be as helpful knowing we chose their enemy over them. Second, they have not categorically refused to help \u2013 they have been part of many co-counter-terror operations in the South Asian region even including operations in Afghanistan. They are part of the group known as the Joint Working Group. [1] Third, India has increased its support after the Mumbai terror attacks. From that point India has realized its own stake in the war on terror. [1] Fourth, TURN India in a long-run geopolitical sense is more important than Pakistan. Tolpolar writes, India became the sixth largest bilateral donor to Afghanistan, it has pledged to spend $1.2billion on helping rebuild the country\u2019s shattered infrastructure. Funds have been committed for education, health, power and telecommunications. There has also been money in the form of food aid and help to strengthen governance\u2026 On Pakistan\u2019s side, there are concerns over the increasing Indian influence in Afghanistan. \u201cAfghanistan has been a prize that Pakistan and India have fought over directly and indirectly for decades\u201d wrote analyst Robert D Kaplan. Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf openly accused Afghan President Hamid Karzai of being subservient to India.\u201d This is highly important because as Pakistan is devolving further into anarchy and factionism, India is continuing to expand its geopolitical power in the region. Between the two it makes most sense to favor progression rather than regression. Pro C1: Pakistan and Terrorism My opponent argues that the ISI is distinct from the government which means we shouldn\u2019t hold the government accountable. However there are a few problems: First, is evidence even indicates the government funds the entirety of the ISI \u2013 if the government really wanted to reform this organization they could easily restrict funding. However this is not the case, which makes the government complicit in the actions of the ISI. Second, he dropped my evidence which indicates that the president of Pakistan himself has come out in support for the goals of the Afghani Taliban and released prisoners for being associated with said group. Third, regardless of the ISI acting rouge it is still the main intelligence agency for the Pakistani government and has continuously spat in the face of people trying to aid the U.S.. As much as my opponent has faith in Pakistan, the ISI literally has the country\u2019s government officials and military in the palm of their organizations hand. The ISI had hid Bin Laden, refuses to take necessary actions in the FATA region and both implicitly and explicitly aids the Afghani Taliban and Al Qaeda. Con C2: Pakistani Nuclear Capability My opponent argues that because of the U.S.-Pak relationship their nuclear weapons have been safe away from the hands of terrorists. Few problems: First, Pakistan, regardless of a U.S. alliance will protect its nuclear arsenal from terrorists because India has a nuclear arsenal of its own (also a stronger conventional military) which would deter nuclear terror and also that as mentioned in my own evidence there are many terror groups looking to destabilize the Pakistan state, e.g. the Pak-Taliban. In both cases Pakistan has a clear incentive to protect its arsenal. Second, terrorists can get nuclear materials from North Korea, Iran (low grade for dirty bomb) and also evacuated sites in the former U.S.S.R. Con C3: China My opponent argues that China is seeking a relationship with China and moving towards India would solidify this relationship. Few problems: First, this relationship is going to occur with or without a U.S. Indian Alliance. As my opponents evidence indicates: \u201cChinese Premier Wen Jiabao last year called Sino-Pakistani ties \u2018firm as a rock,\u2019 and his Pakistani counterpart echoed the sentiment Monday.\u201d Thus, even if the U.S. moves away from Pakistan, a Sino-Pak relationship has already occurred and is inevitable for the future. Second, TURN: this Sino-Pak relationship actually helps the U.S. WoT. Pakistan must deal with the Pak-Taliban regardless of a U.S. alliance since the very stability of Pakistan deals with this issue. However, with a Sino-Pak relationship then Pakistan will have its own obligation to China to combat jihadist groups linked to other groups within China. [2] By extension the terror networks that are intermingled on the Sino-Pak border will be dismantled. [2] http://www.cacianalyst.org... Pro C2: U.S.-Indian Alliance would force Pakistan\u2019s hand My opponent argues that since China and Pakistan are in this emerging alliance, Pakistan won\u2019t be compelled to give into the U.S.\u2019 demands because China will fill this spot. Moreover, he makes a very interesting argument that says a Sino-Pak and U.S.-Indian bloc will be undesirable for all parties involved. However, TURN: if the U.S. does not counter-balance the Sino-Pak alliance with a U.S.-Indian Alliance then Chinese expansionism will be undeterred. This evidence indicates that China is vastly infringing on Indian waters in the Indian Ocean and establishing both military and commercial sites in the Indian Ocean. Chinese expansionism in the region, for the long-run, is undesirable for the U.S. because it increases Chinese competitional power against the U.S.. [3] AND TURN: this destabilizes the region. This evidence indicates that India will be cornered without U.S. assistance which would result in clashes on the Sino-Indian and Pak-Indian borders. And as mentioned above, all of these nations have a nuclear arsenal\u2026and put into the light of historical analysis India has not gotten along with Pakistan or China (India had major wars with both).

            "text": "OK, thanks for the arguments. I will concentrate on the fact that Pakistan is a more important to the United States than India. My contentions: 1. Pakistan is an important ally in the War on the terror While my opponent brought up the ISI and how it contributing against the US in the War on Terror, he didn't explain how Pakistan is such an important ally in the war on terror despite this rogue organization. Politicians in Pakistan are arguing that the War on Terror has cost the Pakistan economy $70 billion since 2001. (http://www.supportimrankhan.org...) This 70 Billion dollars that Pakistan has spent already is much larger than the $20 billion we have sent in the form of aid. (http://www.reuters.com...) Our closest ally, the United Kingdom, has contributed $30.6 billion dollars since 2001. (http://www.telegraph.co.uk...) So financially, this means that Pakistan is not only our closest ally in the Middle East but also our closest ally in the WORLD. So why then, would we shift our focus to India, who refuses to help us in the war on terror? (www.atlantic-community.org/app/.../Presentation_India_PAPER.pdf) To do such would be an unparalleled show of betrayal by our government. 2. The US alliance with Pakistan helps safeguard Pakistan's nuclear capability from terrorists. Of the 50 Muslim-majority states in the world, Pakistan is the only which has developed nuclear weapons. Thus, it is a great target for jihadist organizations. The US influence over Pakistan helps keep Pakistan's nuclear secrets away from countries like Iran and organizations like Al-Qaeda. Keeping these weapons out of the hands of terrorists and Iran is paramount to national security concerns. Whereas India's weapons are safely guarded. http://www.irantracker.org... http://nuclearweaponarchive.org... 3. China is increasing its influence over Pakistan China recognizes the importance of Pakistan, and thus is increasing it's influence on Pakistan. By shifting the geopolitical strategy to India, the result would be less cooperation from Pakistan. Whereas India would not come under the sway of China due to tensions in between the two. Therefore, a shift toward India would maintain the alliance with India only, and it is logical to say that a shift with Pakistan would preserve the alliance with both. (http://articles.cnn.com...) Now onto my opponents case: C1: Pakistan's ISI is rooted in Islamic fundamentalism and has ties to terror organizations I will not deny that the ISI supports terrorism, but he ISI is a rogue organization which operates independently of the government. The Pakistan Spectator even stated, \"Even though technically ISI is an organization funded/controlled by the state, it is a controversial, sometimes rogue organization that Benazir Bhutto, the late Pakistani prime minister, once termed a \"state within a state\" for its tendency to operate outside of the Pakistani government's control, thus answerable neither to the leadership of the army, nor to the President or the Prime Minister.\" If anything, this unstable organization dictates more US involvement, not less, so a geopolitical shift away from Pakistan would be illogical and unsupportable. C2: Supporting India would force the Pakistani's hand I believe this contention falls because my opponent does not take into account China's increased presence in Pakistan. It can therefore be contended that Pakistan is likely to just give up playing this diplomatic game with the US and India , and instead go to China, who has shown full support of Pakistan. It would be illogical to assume that Pakistan will continue being forced by the US into change when they have an equally powerful and eager ally in China. See my third contention for information about China's increased presence as I believe it counters this contention. In the end, a China-Pakistan bloc competing with a US-India bloc is undesirable given the tensions between all the countries involved. I look forward to your rebuttals."

The Local DK, 10-31-14\" \"A University of Sydney, Australia, study found that:70% of Australian men view porn online (the article quotes that some surveys show the number as high as 90%). The average first exposure to porn is age 11.80% of 15 to 17 year olds have had multiple exposures to hard core porn. Newcastle Herald, September 12, 2014\" We see consistently throughout modern societies, porn is something that is being used by the majority of citizens. A majority following for that culture means it is considered to moral for that society. I'll give a hypothetical, slavery is frowned upon in current societies, therefore it is considered immoral for our societies standards, however, if a society generally accepts slavery as something that is acceptable, then it would be considered moral for that society to empose it. A non-hypothetical would be the Aztecs in the 1400s. When Europeans landed in the New World in 1492 they witnessed the human sacrifices that occurred in these areas and then imposed their morality unto them by determining that these people must be evil, because they had a ritual of killing people for the gods. However, to them it was considered moral because it was acceptable for their society. This is a very good example of cultural relavism. Porn is similar to this, as it is generally accepted and used as a means to enjoy onself. Back to you Pro"

            "text": "You said pornography is not an art, well, art is about dealing with the nature of beauty. Nudity is restricted or prohibited in most societies, but some depiction of nudity may serve a recognized social function. A major context for depictions of nudity are the arts, both fine art and the popular arts. Nudity is also allowed when it is seen as supporting a useful purpose, such as s-x education. Porn is art (https://en.wikipedia.org...) There are a lot of famous artists whom made nude art. Pornography is not bad. That's why it's legal. Argument 1 : Relationship Effect In a small study from the University of Montreal in 2009 -- also self-reporting -- the male participants claimed that watching porn didn\"t change their views of women or impact their relationships. An oft-repeated punchline of the study was that the researchers tried, and failed, to find men who had never viewed porn. Then there was a 2009 study by Michael Twohig (cited in Sunny Side ) from the University of Utah, which asked students whether or not their porn consumption was problematic. Twohig found that porn itself didn\"t affect the students\" mental state; it was only a problem when they tried to control their urge to watch it. http://www.alternet.org... You said \" It allows men and women alike to fore go the necessary steps in cultivating a relationship with another person\" -When you view sex it does not mean you can just have sex to whom you want. No women would open up their legs for a man whom she don't know the name. People only have sex to whom they have utmost/highest degree of trust. The only necessary steps in cultivating a relationship is to build up a foundation of bond, nobody needs to go overboard and marry the person. Sex is natural, and religion is not for anybody. Nobody skips the steps, believe me. Since the only necessary steps are subjective and can be of a minimum of minutes actually. Most women do not view porn, but if they do, it does not mean that they are hungry for sex and want to have sex with all those handsome beings on the road. The steps to take is the woman's decision and porn does not do that bad. You said \"Porn contained physical and verbal abuse of female performers\" . It does influence, but not to the point that someone who watched porn would be a different person afterward. It is merely a scene, and it shows intense intimacy. Watching porn is like watching movies, they do contain physical and verbal abuse. Porn and movies are legal and not banned because the world do revolve on that actions naturally. Porn's impact on relationships is up to the person himself. Don't worry, watching porn does not make you an animal-craving mind. At the end of the day, you are still a rational being naturally wanting art. Beneficial to a Happier Sex Life Most internet pornography is actually pretty damn funny and watching it together can encourage conversation and laughter between couples. By encouraging laughing and communication combined with physical arousal, internet pornography can be a sexual enhancer. A Danish study showed viewing hardcore pornography has \"had primarily a positive effect f on various aspects of their lives\" for men and women. (Hald and Malamuth: Self-Perceived Effects of Pornography Consumption) Read more: http://www.cracked.com... Those verbal and physical abuse of spanking and etc are just role plays. Just like in a movie, when someone kills, it does not even mean that you should kill. It's just a way of entertainment as it is. Argument 2 : Porn-hunger fuels sex trafficking It is actually the other way around. Diamond's study took a slightly different tact. Diamond and his team were reviewing previous studies that supported the \"fact\" that pornography use increases a person's likelihood to commit sex crimes, and that the more pornography is dispersed the higher the sex crime numbers become. Diamond's study concluded that these myths are in fact myths, and that generally speaking there is absolutely no proven link between pornography in a culture or society and the rate of sex crimes. In fact, according to Diamond, it seems that when pornography is readily available sex crimes either remain steady, or decrease. Isn't that something? It seems that by watching sex on film you may feel better about yourself, your life, and even the opposite sex. Though it wasn't a part of the study, I would venture to say that pornography could also be used as a teaching tool, an aphrodesiac, and even an activity that consenting adults could participate in together. Watching it, or making it, whatever floats your boat as long as everyone has a good time. http://voices.yahoo.com... Decreasing the Rate of Sex Crimes Internet porn creates an outlet for violent fantasies, which can decrease sex crimes. Just think about comparative research. Studies have shown that when violent films are released, the rates violent crimes decrease. Researchers have also learned that the rates of murders committed by males in their mid-teens dropped significantly when explicitly violent video games became popular. Of course, correlation and causation are not the same (but it does allow for a heated discussion that might just have some getting a little hot). Comparison studies, although interesting (to some), are not necessary. Considering that everywhere scientific studies were conducted produced the same results: an increase in the availability and acceptance of pornography has the effect of decreasing sex crimes (Results were published in 2009 by Diamond: Pornography, public acceptance and sex related crime: a review.) Read more: http://www.cracked.com... You posted something about slavery. Porn is a billion-dollar industry which employs thousands. An epidemiological study of 30,000 American men by Michael Leitzman, a cancer researcher at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, has found that men who enjoy an active sex life do not risk prostate cancer in later life. There has been a suggested link with greater sexual activity and increased incidents of prostate cancer in previous scientific data because of the link with the male hormone testosterone and its effect on promoting cancer cell growth. Leitzmann's findings were that men who ejaculate between 13 and 20 times a month had a 14% lower risk of prostate cancer that men who ejaculated on average, between 4 and 7 times a month for most of their adult life. Men who ejaculated upwards of 21 times a month had a 33% lower lifetime risk of prostate cancer than the baseline group. At the end of the day, porn is not bad. Pornography is an art, as many artists/painters/sculptors create it. Porn is legally accepted. It is a natural phenomenon."

I will then deconstruct your bizarre assertion that homosexual behaviour 'influences kids'. __________________________________ Here is an excerpt of mine from a previous debate on this topic: \"The right to engage in a relationship with another person is fundamental to the human condition. Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: \"All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.\" [http://www.un.org...] Furthermore, Article 2 of the same declaration demands \"[e]veryone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind...\" I also made the case that, - Having relationships with other people is not a privilege, it is a right - Formalising that relationship through marriage is also a right - Two homosexuals getting married does not infringe upon anyone else's rights to marriage - It is the business of those two people. No one else. I will now address your assertion that homosexuality is something that can influence children. The scientific literature is clear on this topic: homosexuality is not a choice [http://www.iflscience.com...]. As an example, I present this thought experiment. I am a heterosexual male, and I have a girlfriend. I enjoy kissing her and spooning and all the things that go along with being in a relationship with a female. To me, the idea of kissing/having sex with a male does not even remotely excite me, and causes a pretty unpleasant feeling; I would not wish to engage in a relationship with a man. I could not possibly choose to want to have sex with a man, because I am heterosexual and I'm just not built that way. Could you possibly foresee yourself making the CHOICE to sleep with someone of the same gender? Unless you are born homo-, bi- or asexual, you are going to be attracted to people of the opposite gender. However, being born gay would mean that this thought experiment works in reverse. The thought of sleeping with someone of the opposite sex likely repulses them, and yet they are forced to do so to conform to artificial, arbitrary social standards which aren't helpful to anyone. The only two people that are affect by a gay couple are the people in that relationship. Children seeing a gay couple might become more tolerant, or feel more comfortable coming out if they already are gay, but it will certainly not 'turn them gay'. This is just absurd. Best of luck for you round."

You have stated no Pros, so ill move on to the Gay \"Cons\". No natural kids: This has no bearing on the debate, the debate is over the legality of Gay rights. The only people this argument effects are the homosexuals themselves, not us, so what gives? It's their choice then. Illegal Act: This doesn't support your case when the debate is over the legality of the subject. Not approved of: What? Gays going to hell: First of all, again your using Christian arguments without proving your source. But even if i granted you the source in this debate, that doesn't mean all gays are going to hell. There is only one unforgivable sin, which i'm sure an educated Christian such as yourself knows is blasphemy of the holy spirit. Now, since being gay is not said blasphemy, even gays have a chance to get into heaven. Cant get married in most places around the world: This is basically saying, \"We can't make Gay marriage legal because it's illegal\" That doesn't have a bearing on the debate seeing as that's what it's based upon. Cant be in the military: You should be able to, you could lie anyways if you wanted to. I have argued your Cons, now i will present my Pros. You could adopt kids, and have a family with someone you love. (Picture yourself trying to have a family and love another man as a husband, this is basically what your asking homosexuals to do) It just wouldn't be right. Allowing freedom over how you make your family allows happiness for all. You could feel good about the way you are, rather than trying to hide it from judgmental \"normal\" folk. I don't feel the need to go on, nothing you have states is bad for us as a whole for allowing or being gay. The only thing you have said is that it would be bad for the homosexual himself, which is based off the premise of rules already set in place that SHOULD be changed. \"THEY SHOULD NOT BE ANY RIGHTS FOR GAYS, THEY ARE NO RIGHT FOR ANY OTHER CRIMES AGAINST NATURE OR FOR ANY CRIMES AT ALL ONCE U COMMENT A CRIME U LOSE YOUR RIGHTS.\" There is no crime being committed, therefore using your logic, gays SHOULD have rights. Ladies and Gentleman, my opponent has argued the Bible without backing it up, he has used lame arguments without backing them up, he makes it sound like your sexual orientation is changeable via the push of a button. He is advocating that we should not all have equal rights, he has not shown why Homosexuals should not be afforded the protection of the 14th amendment, he has said being Gay is a bad and/or wrong thing without backing it up, this is only a short list of the flaws he has committed in this debate, do what you know is right."

            "text": "Thanks to my opponent for accepting this debate. My first argument is that most children are taught not to lie, cheat, steal, disobey, or hurt people. If a child is spanked because they hit someone else, the child is getting mixed signals from the adult administering the punishment. They are being hurt for hurting someone else. This leads them to believe that as long as they are \"right\" or have the right intentions, it is okay to hurt someone else. They also believe that physically striking someone is an acceptable method of communicating disappointment. Spanking has been known to lead to increased aggression and domestic violence: \"One important question was the direction of causality: Did aggressive, difficult children get punished or did punishment lead to aggression? Large prospective studies in the mid- to-late 1990s, controlling for children's antisocial behavior and a host of other possible confounders, showed that physical punishment predicted later antisocial behavior.\"[1] My second argument is that spanking has no positive effect: \"An analysis of research conducted since the 1990 adoption of the UN's Convention on the Rights of the Child suggests that no studies have found positive consequences of physical punishment, according to Joan Durrant, PhD, of the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, and Ron Ensom, MSW, of the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa.\"[1] My next argument is that studies have linked spanking to mental disorders such as: \" The risk of major depression was 41 percent higher; The risk of mania was 93 percent higher; The risk of any mood disorder was 49 percent higher; The risk of any anxiety disorder was 36 percent higher; The risk of any alcohol abuse or dependence was 59 percent higher; The risk of any drug abuse or dependence was 53 percent higher.[2] My last opening argument is that spanking has been shown in studies to lower a child's intelligence: \"Straus and colleagues measured spanking and IQ level in 806 children aged two to four and 704 children aged five to nine. Four years later, children aged two to four who were spanked had IQ scores on average five points lower than children who were not spanked in the same age group. Similarly, children aged five to nine who were spanked had IQ scores 2.8 points lower than children who were not spanked in the same age group. The researchers also found that the greater the number of times a child was spanked, the slower the development of the child\"s mental ability.\" [3] Seeing that recent studies can not show any benefit from spanking to the child and that it has the potential to cause them to become more aggressive, less intelligent, and a wide array of social and mental disorders; spanking is detrimental to the personal growth and intellect of children and is therefore immoral. 1. www.medpagetoday.com/Pediatrics/Parenting/31030 2. www.abcnews.go.com/Health/spanking-kids-leads-adult-mental-illnesses/story?id=16695697#.UG_18k3u0iU 3. www.njpsychologist.com/blog/spankings-long-term-effect-on-intelligence/"

Personally, I see that a load of people shoved off to the suburbs after WW2, spent dough, worked, raised the people that refused to have women not-work, refused to subjugate people of color, set off to find them selves and then, made the huge mistake of having children as the oil people started to ruin every thing.

Admittedly, parents in our world aren\u2019t always what we wish them to be, but we insist that they do more harm than good. The Prop has denied the immense risks associated with abortion, which stretch from acute hematometra (post-abortal syndrome) to breast cancer, infertility, and increased risk for clinical depression and suicide. [[http://www.abort73.com/abortion_facts/us_abortion_statistics]] \u201cA large-scale, authoritative Scandinavian study shows post-pregnancy death rates within one year that are nearly four times greater among women who abort their pregnancies than among women who bear their babies. The suicide rate is nearly six times greater among aborting women than among women who give birth. These findings refute the oft-heard claim that induced abortion is safer than childbirth.\u201d[[http://www.deveber.org/text/whealth.]] The myth that childbirth is more risky than abortion is largely based on the way that statistics about abortion-related deaths are collected: such deaths are often attributed to present problems. These are risks that parents have a right and a responsibility to evaluate for their minor children, who are by law as well as by custom the responsibility of parents. So why should abortions need consent when a decision to keep the child doesn\u2019t? Quite simply, the nature of pregnancy in most cases necessitates parental involvement, since it is rarely kept a secret, and almost always requires emotional and material support. The law need not step in where immediacy does. In truth, each of the options, including abortion, carry with them serious and long-term risks that need to be not only carefully considered, but offset with the kind of support a parent is best able to give."

He has leadership experience as captain of Indian youth teams and, more importantly, he's now the right age and has matured into a top-class batsman. Even more importantly, he has shown his mettle overseas by scoring runs in difficult arenas like the WACA and the Bullring This is the sort of inspiration India need to boost their overseas record. However, what they need even more is a proactive captain who can get the best out of his bowlers when playing in unfamiliar conditions Kohli needs to be brave as an India captain. Instead of placing defensive fields for Ishant Sharma's wayward deliveries he has to challenge him by deploying men designed to aid the bowler, as long as he maintains line and length. If Ishant can't oblige him, he has to find another bowler who can. While Dhoni's tendency to rely on batsmen making mistakes and getting themselves out works brilliantly in the shorter forms of the game, the ploy is often exposed as flawed when gritty opponents like McCullum mount a counterattack in Test matches Dhoni's latest injury may be fortuitous. It gives the selectors a chance to evaluate Kohli's leadership credentials in the one-day arena, and if he's successful, they should appoint him Test captain"

He was replacing Shaun Pollock who had done little wrong in his three years at the helm - winning 14 of 26 Tests and 59 of 92 ODIs. He had commanded the ship with grace in the aftermath of the match-fixing turbulence and was all of 30. Surely, a brain freeze on a Duckworth-Lewis equation wasn't enough reason to show him the door? South Africa though weren't swayed by the numbers. When Pollock replaced Hansie Cronje, he was the right man for the wrong time. He was now the good man at the wrong time. From his innate decency, South Africa needed to graduate to a new language. Its cricketers needed a new man to re-ignite their joy of playing cricket. Smith was a young and passionate, talented and ambitious. He may or may not have been ready to be captain, but his country's cricket team needed his kind in-charge. India faces a similar dilemma at this point and must make a similar choice. MS Dhoni has the numbers to stay on at the helm, but appears to have lost the sparkle that once defined his leadership. His decision-making has been consistently feeble and often frustrating over the last 18 months. His poise in explaining away defeats was once endearing but increasingly sounds like a shallow play on words. Nonchalance is admirable but when the setbacks pile up - eight straight overseas defeats and three consecutive World Twenty20s without a place in the semis - the skipper can't swat the gnawing questions aside. Theorising about cricket captaincy is one of the great pastimes of the game. Must he lead by example at all times? Must he first command a place as a player? Must he be tactically sound or simply rely on instinct? Must he inspire and cajole? Or must he merely rely on a nudge and a quiet word? It is unlike any other job in the world, sporting or otherwise. You are captain one day and a mere player on another. One day you lead, on another you are led. One day you could move a man from third man to point, the next you could be following a similar diktat. In Dhoni's case several boxes are being rapidly unchecked. Over the last year, he has first been picked as captain and is then somehow fit into the XI, especially in Test and Twenty20 cricket. Over the seven Tests he played in England and Australia, Dhoni scored a mere 322 runs at an average of 27. In the World Twenty20, he batted all of 51 balls in the entire competition, when several occasions demanded he promote himself in the batting order. In the longest and shortest formats of the game, Dhoni is captain first and wicketkeeper-batsman almost as an afterthought. Power equations in Indian cricket have meant Dhoni's position has been unquestioned. Murmurs suggest a move to remove him as captain for the Asia Cup immediately after the tour of Australia was scuttled. His writ is the final word on marginal selections - RP Singh's sudden recall and Suresh Raina's re-instatement in the Test team are glaring examples. Five years in the job with all the machinations around Indian cricket have meant Dhoni is now conditioned to being captain first and all else later. But the aura has faded as the results have nosedived. If only for his own good, Dhoni the cricketer now needs to be disengaged from Dhoni the captain. He must be free to fight with claimants to the spot of India's No.1 wicket-keeper batsman. He must re-discover the joy of clattering the cricket ball into orbit, much in the manner when he first emerged. He must be allowed to relish the contest at par with the pretenders to his place in the squad. Tactics and player management should no longer be his lookout, his mind and body must be liberated to play cricket. There comes a time when cricketers should be cricketers alone- and with Dhoni that time is now. It won't take a genius to find the successor. Much like Smith in 2003, Virat Kohli is a feisty young man with the world at his feet. He is the first name on all Indian teams these days - Test, ODI and Twenty20. His tears at the end of the World Twenty20 were a reminder that failure must rankle before it is explained. That India's cricket team impacts its followers and must do the same to its players. Does he have the nous and the tactical acumen? He may or may not, but unless he gets the opportunity one will never know. India starts an arduous journey in late 2013 in South Africa which will take them to New Zealand, England and Australia over the next year. The next Indian captain shouldn't start in the job with that itinerary staring at him. The opportunity to blood Kohli is now - make him captain starting with the Test series against England. He is the new language India needs - one that will lift them from this listlessness. The opponent may set forth his or her argument"

            "text": "I'll address each paragraph of my opponent's last post and add anything else I'd like to end off on. Whether or not Affirmative Action can be successful or not is irrelevant to the topic of this debate. The debate is discussing whether or not it's fair. Regardless though, I'll address how even though it worked well for Stomayor Affirmative Action can potentially harm minorities. It's due to a process called the \"mismatch\". Because more students are being accepted from inferior schools when they find themselves at a higher level university or college than they'd normally be at, it often leads to high dropout rates. (1) For example, although more African Americans tend to pursue science/engineering majors than Caucasians, African Americans dropout of the fields at twice the rate of Caucasians. (1) African Americans are also twice as likely to stop pursing a doctorate if they go to a school where they've been mismatched. (1) African Americans tend to rank in the bottom 20% of their classes. (1) Finally, African Americans tend to rank in the bottom 10% of their classes in law school and African American law school grads are 4 time more likely to fail their bar exams (I'll address this again later). (1) For all these students who are going to schools they may not normally go to, this is unfair to them because they may have had great success elsewhere. I'm not saying that universities shouldn't accept those who come from low income areas, but they shouldn't be expected to accept a certain amount of racial minorities and only accept those that have the greatest chance of succeeding (like Sotomayor), which can determined from personal essays and to a lesser degree SAT scores (should be at least somewhat close to the average for their institution). This is why so many schools accept African Americans from higher income areas, so they are following Affirmative Action. Affirmative Action not taking into account economic status and an example of a poor Asian American being rejected for a rich African American are related, because it shows how Affirmative Action isn't really meeting its goal of balancing the playing field, because if they accounted more for economic status the Asian American would be accepted (even though there will be more people at a top school of his race than the African American). UMC was just one example of a law school that has that policy, as I mentioned in my previous post most law schools follow this. The cited source made mention of that. This would explain why African Americans tend to finish low in their classes for law school and are much more likely to fail the Bar Exam. The \"strongly imply\" was more of a technicality, that was pretty much exactly what it was. Anyways, yes, they take into account economic status, but the fact remains schools want to take in the best candidates possible, while still following the Affirmative Action, so they will try to find richer blacks if they can. Like my opponent said though, they still take into account economic status which make involving race just seem completely unfair and unnecessary. The facts are that universities are expected to even out the races at their institutions to be similar to the federal population and/or state population. At high end schools, this will almost always hurt Asian Americans. This ultimately why Asian Americans are not being accepted as much. To use another country with very similar culture, Canada, they do not focus in on race as much as American schools do. The result is that they often have lots of Asians on campus. In fact, at one of Canada's top universities, the University of British Columbia, people have joked for a long time that UBC stands for the \"University of a Billion Chinese\". (2) Canadian universities will have very similar application processes to US Universities, accept they don't have to account for race. Also, yes, Canada has a higher percentage of Asians than the US, but the amount of Canadian universities (especially in engineering/science departments) will be much higher than the total percentage. To end off on this point, even though Asian parents may be known for having their kids to study a lot, they also install a really strong work ethic in them that universities crave for. Yes, Asians are known for being smart. But the reason people thinks they're smart is because they think they study all the time and do nothing else. This can act as a hindrance, because like my opponent mentioned, universities like to have individualized personalities, and that is not what many people think of Asian Americans. Like I mentioned earlier too, is it not discrimination for an Asian American who otherwise would have been accepted to be rejected, because there are too many of his/her race (something he/she cannot control) attending the school? Overall, I believe Affirmative Action is unfair because it focuses on race, which can negatively affect someone based on a factor they cannot control. To end off, I'd like to thank my opponent for accepting and participating in this debate. 1-http://www.theatlantic.com... 2-http://syruptrap.ca..."

            "text": "The idea of affirmative action in education, that is taking action to improve access to a better education and therefore higher income and more socioeconomic power for historically disadvantaged groups, is great.  I take issue, however, with the way that it is implemented.  \n\nPlease feel free to correct me if I am wrong but my understanding of the process is this:  universities use different standards when evaluating applicants from different races and ethnicities.  Typically this means more rigorous evaluation for white people and Asians, as they have more overall representation in higher education ,and less rigorous standards for African-American and Hispanic applicants who are less represented and suffer higher rates of poverty per capita.  This is more or less how it works, right?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have two suggestions for improvement:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Why not use income rather than race/ethnicity to determine access to such programs?**  Poverty is brutal no matter what race you are.  And it's going to be really tough for poor kids to be judged by the same standards as their upper middle class peers.  I spent part of my teen years in western PA surrounded by what some people derisively call \"trailer trash\".  They were not predisposed to education because a lot of their parents were alcoholic or drug addicted or in prison.  Did not read them many bedtime stories or help them with homework. Never got to take advantage of their white privilege because all there really is is white people where they live.  My girlfriend on the other hand is an immigrant from Colombia, she looks about as brown as Taylor Swift and her parents are both high earners but she is undeniably Latinx so she used that to get into the University of Pennsylvania with scholarships.  Not that I blame her!  Why not game the system if you can? My point is it would be more fair to use income with these programs than race/ethnicity? \n2. **Why are we focusing on higher education in the first place?**  It seems to me that if you want to improve education, income, and standards of living of disadvantaged people then the thing to do is to improve elementary education.  Tens of millions of Americans of all races never even apply to college because they hated school and did terrible.  I know that it's really difficult in the United States to have any kind of coordinated policy on primary education but I think as a society we should be focused on improving literacy and basic education in impoverished school districts if we really want to do something about inequality.  As far as higher education goes I think we should accept that for a lot of people coming from working class backgrounds an ideal post high school education might not look like university at all: [https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/curse-college-article-1.1269198](https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/curse-college-article-1.1269198)\n\nAnyway, just my two cents.  Am I missing something?  Change my view"

Affirmative Case To win this debate, I only have to provide one instance of where veganism is not good for everyone. Veganism requires strict observance of diet in order for someone to remain healthy. I think it is reasonable to assume that 'healthy' equates to 'good'. For example, the vitamin B-12 is not sufficiently found it plants (it is best found in meat), due to the amount varying to as little as no B-12 [1]. If you cannot access vitamin B-12 in supplement form, then you should not be a vegan. Therefore, the instance(s) of where veganism is not good for everyone is where people do not have access to vitamin B-12 supplements (such as people who live in Africa where clean water is hard enough to find, let alone supplements like these). I can provide many other instances, should my opponent provide any counter-arguments. Until then, the resolution is affirmed. References: [1] Billings TE, 1999.

            "text": "Thanks a lot for your argument, it is much appreciated. My rebuttal for all three of the above arguments offered by pro is very similar. All of these studies are observational. They demonstrate correlation, but not causation [1]. I can attribute this to the fact that many vegan eaters are more health conscious in general, as veganism is normally applied as a health choice, and are more likely to be healthy, not because of their vegan habits, but because vegans are more likely to exercise, less likely to smoke, and more likely to be married [2]. All of these factors have also been attributed to longer life. This is especially applicable to the third argument offered. There is no reason antioxidants cannot be obtained from an omnivorous diet, as omnivores can eat all of the same foods vegans can, and therefore have the same amount of sources for antioxidants, with additional benefits and nutrients as well as essential amino acids offered from meat, eggs, etc. Although the above arguments cannot be proven to stem from causation, even playing the devil's advocate, if they could be proven so, they still could not outweigh the positive effects of omnivorism, e.g. protein, certain vitamins, amino acids, omega-3's. A health conscious, natural-eating omnivore has a better chance at a healthy life than a vegan. In a recent study, Adkins-diet (high fat, low carbs, a healthy, omnivorous diet) using overweight women were compared with Ornish diet (high carbs, low fat. Basically a vegan diet) using overweight women. (These women were randomly assigned to the diets) The Adkins diet users lost more weight and had more beneficial metabolic results [3]. This study DOES demonstrate causation as the women were randomly assigned to the diets and were not pre-existing omnivores/vegans. Thank you for your time. [1] http://authoritynutrition.com...

            "text": "--Introduction-- I thank my opponent for her opening round. However, this isn't a debate about whether veganism is better than non-veganism in general, but about whether veganism is healthier or not with regards to our diets in general. Therefore, even if it was unethical to slaughter animals, which I do not grant, that has no bearing on the topic of the debate (neither does the odour of one's farts I believe). --Responding To My Opponent's Relevant Points-- My opponent only makes two points that are relevant to the debate topic: i) Since meat takes longer to digest it causes harm to the digestive system ii) Veganism can help lower cholesterol Unfortunately, the first claim is just utterly false. Humans have been eating meat for thousands of years and our digestive systems are well adapted with regards to meat consumption regardless of whether it takes more time to digest meat or not. As dietitian Fiona Carruthers notes: \"Meat will generally leave the stomach 2-3 hours and be fully digested in 4-6 hours. Our digestive system is well designed to digest meat in order to use its wide range of nutrients such as iron, zinc, and B vitamins.\" - Fiona Carruthers Also, there is no good evidence that dietary cholesterol has any negative effect on cholesterol in the blood. There is \"good\" cholesterol (HDL) and \"bad\" cholesterol (LDL). It is true that the saturated fat in meat raises LDL but it also raises HDL too. HDL is actually associated with a reduced risk of health problems [1] [2] [3]. Also not all LDL is linked to negative cardiovascular issues. Dense LDL is linked to heart disease, but large LDL is benign. Here is the kicker; saturated fat actually converts dense LDL to large LDL [4] [5] [6] So the saturated fat in meat raises both the \"good\" cholesterol and \"bad\" cholesterol but also converts dense LDL into large LDL. Therefore, the myth that the saturated fat increases the risk of heart disease contradicts today's best science. --Reasons Why Non-Veganism Is The Healthier Choice-- i) Animal protein provides the best protein. For one, it is more rich in essential amino acids than plant protein. Also, animal protein causes better bone mineral density [7], while protein in plant sources is linked with lower density. Plant protein comes with plant toxins as well, which probably serves as the best explanation as to why plant protein is associated with a risk of diseases [8]. Additionally, animal sources of protein are more nutrient dense, meaning to get the same amount of protein from non-animal sources entails more carbohydrates entering the body than necessary. ii) Fat-soluble vitamins A and D are lacking in vegan diets. Vegetables that are claimed to have vitamin A really only have carotene (a precursor to vitamin A). Vitamin D is in the same boat; people claim mushrooms have Vitamin D but it only contains Vitamin D2 (which is poorly absorbed). iii) A vegan diet without heavy Soy consumption is extremely difficult. The problem with Soy is the phytoestrogen, which causes hormone imbalances (even in infants [9]). iv) Vitamin K2 is what transfers calcium to our bones; vegan diets lack it. v) Out of all the different groups of eaters, vegans have he highest rate of vitamin B12 deficiency. The B12 that is readily absorbed can only be found in animal sources. vi) Omega-3 in plants are only ALA. ALA needs to be converted to EPA or DPA and this conversion is very poor. --Conclusion-- My opponent's reasons for thinking Veganism is healthier are misconceived. I provided six powerful reasons as to why Non-Veganism is healthier. I await my opponent's response. --Sources-- [1] http://jamanetwork.com... [2] http://circ.ahajournals.org...
