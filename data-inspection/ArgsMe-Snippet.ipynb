    "The arguments above convey con stance towards Trump. They express criticism that addresses mainly racism and his position towards immigration. trump-02 starts with showing that Trump is a racist, continues with declaring racism is wrong, and finally gives evidence that it harms society. Its corresponding snippet points out that he is a racist and racism is wrong. trump-04 takes up some points made by pro-side regarding racism and immigration. Its first snippet sentence is the author's comment on the pro-point, while the second seems to be part of the pro-point itself. The last argument gives reasons why racism is bad, especially on a nationwide scale. Furthermore, it mentions problems with a militia that hunts immigrants. Its snippet captures the latter and that Trump causes such organizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding other snippets that introduce more contrastiveness seems to be difficult (if we also want to preserve some representativeness): Even though the main aspects are racism and immigration, each of the arguments shows different facets and is thereby already sufficiently contrastive. "

To split the information to the different snippets the following snippets seem suitable. death_penalty-07's snippet keeps sentence 28 and takes sentence 35 instead of 29."

We see that snippet sentences are connected not only among sentences from their arguments but also across argument borders. Especially, CC-06:02 is similar to CC-08:01 and CC-08:02, and thus, is a good candidate to be dropped for a contrastive snippet. Sentences CC-06:01 and CC-06:03 are pretty connected among the sentences of their argument and therefore might be representative while they are less similar to sentences of CC-08. If we select CC-06:01 and CC-06:03 as the contrastive snippet, we choose CC-08:03 instead of CC-08:01 to further increase contrastivness between the snippets. The arguments' texts are shown below.

    "The degree centrality is zero where we left the snippets unchanged. All other contrastive snippets show a decrease compared to the generics, but this is expected as we have to drop a representativeness to some degree in order to integrate contrastiveness. Put differently, we take a step away from the snippet that represents the argument optimally.\n",
    "\n",
    "The snippet-original comparison (soc), i.e. the cosine similarity between the snippet and the complete argument, shows a slightly different situation. First, note that the `change_in_soc` should be zero where `change_in_degree_centrality` is zero, too. It seems, we face floating point computation errors. In almost all cases, soc shows a negative change, too. In contrast, feminism-03, death_penalty-07, death_penalty-08 depict an increase in similarity between the contrastive snippet and the argument compared to the generic snippet and the argument. This indicates the contrastive snippet matches the argument better than the generic one, and therefore, no loss in representativeness.\n",

We can take the fact that the scores for context 'trump' changed only slightly as a hint that the generic snippets are already contrastive while also representing their arguments. A decrease in the representativeness assessment was expected, too. Only the increase of the snippet-original comparison of some arguments give rise to the question whether the metrics are suitable or if face an unexpected phenomenon of representative contrastive snippets. Regarding the argumentativeness, we have to keep in mind that scores themselves are results of another model which might not reflect reality perfectly."
